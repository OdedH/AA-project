Goals of the work

Hayes (1995) makes an extensive study of metrical stress systems, within
a unifying typological framework. The typology is based on earlier work by Hayes
(1985) and McCarthy & Prince (1986); it is marked by several striking asymmetries between iambic and trochaic languages. Hayes makes the following claims:
That all iambic languages are sensitive to syllable weight (quantity); in particular, they stress every heavy syllable (Prince’s (1990) “weight-to-stress”
principle). By contrast, some trochaic languages are quantity-insensitive.
That any iambic language may mix feet of the form ^^, ^—, and —
´
´
´
within the same word. Trochaic languages divide into two separate types
according to the foot shapes they allow, and neither type is a mirror image
of the iambic case.
(1) Iamb
^— or, if necessary, ^ ^ or —
´
´
´
Moraic Trochee ^^ or —
´
´
Syllabic Trochee  ´ , where each may be either — or ^
That iambic languages often lengthen stressed syllables in branching feet
(iambic lengthening, or IL), turning ^^ into ^—. Trochaic languages
´
´
do not.
That iambic languages always assign feet from left to right (LR): there are
no clear cases of RL iambs. Trochaic languages may assign feet in either
direction.
Additional fact: For trochaic languages, LR footing is in complementary
distribution with ﬁnal-syllable extrametricality. (This is a striking gap in
the languages that Hayes catalogs, though Hayes does not explicitly note it,
and to my knowledge it has not been previously noticed; see x18.)
The present paper shows how to reproduce the asymmetric Hayesian typology in a natural way within Optimality Theory. All the above facts are derived
naturally from internal linguistic principles. I propose that iambic languages fail

to mirror trochaic ones because of well-known universal facts: that both (a) realize syllable weight via extra material at the right edge of a syllable1 and (b) almost
invariably realize extrametricality at the right edge of the word (Hayes 1995, 57–
58). In all other respects, the constraint systems used for iambic and trochaic
languages are perfect mirror images of each other. (That is, each metrical constraint has both an iambic version and a mirror-image trochaic version; a single
systemic parameter causes a language to use either all the iambic (right-strong)
versions or else all the trochaic (left-strong) versions of these constraints.2 )
The paper was undertaken as a challenging case study in primitive Optimality Theory (Eisner 1997a, 1997b) or OTP, sketched in x3, in which only
extremely simple and local constraints are available. The question was, could
stress systems really be analyzed in this restricted framework? In particular,
could one dispense with such non-local apparatus as FTBIN (Prince & Smolensky
1993), FOOTFORM (Prince 1990, Cohn & McCarthy 1994), and especially ALIGN
(McCarthy & Prince 1993)? And would the resulting systems be ad hoc and unrelated, or would they help to explain the cross-linguistic facts for metrical (and
non-metrical) stress, such as those listed above?
2.

Foot form and the space of possible constraints

Optimality Theory, or OT (Prince & Smolensky 1993), is surely capable of stating the asymmetric facts reviewed in x1. The question is whether it
can capture them in a linguistically interesting way. At least three strategies are
available within OT, the third being the OTP approach pursued in this paper.
Strategy A. Allow (an incomplete set of) parametric constraints like those in
(2). Each constraint from the STRESSSYSTEM family attempts to specify the stress
system completely: whichever one is ranked highest wins at the expense of the
others.
(2) a. STRESSSYSTEM(Syllabic Trochee, RL, Right): The surface form is
stressed as if footed with syllabic trochees, assigned iteratively from
right to left, with right extrametricality, in the manner of Hayes (1995),
Chapter 3.
b. STRESSSYSTEM(Iamb, LR, None): The surface form is stressed as if
footed with iambs, assigned iteratively from left to right, with no extra1 Kager (1993) likewise uses the asymmetry of syllable structure to explain why iambs tend to be
´
unbalanced, ^—, while trochees tend to be balanced. Kager makes some crucial assumptions that
are deeply at odds with those of the present account—that stress lapse is detectable only within a foot
and not between feet; that stress may fall in mid-foot, (.x.); that stress is attracted to the ﬁrst mora
of a heavy syllable, rather than the second, as suggested here; and ﬁnally, that footing is both directional and seriously iterative, with an ability to “look backward” but not “forward” in order to avoid
clash. The last point means that Kager’s account, while ingenious, cannot be easily expressed within
Optimality Theory.
2 Equivalently, one could say that there is only one version of the constraint, which refers only to
“strong” and “weak” edges. In iambic languages “strong” means “right,” and in trochaic languages it
means “left.”

:::

This is the most direct solution imaginable: a literal restatement of
Hayes’s parametric system. Such a move is superﬁcial, but it is not obviously
wrong or unprincipled. It even achieves a prominent goal of OT research (Prince
& Smolensky 1993): any reranking of the constraints in (2) yields an attested
language.
Yet of course strategy A is hard to take seriously. First, why is it being stated in OT? The central intuition of OT is that phonology emerges through
the interaction of violable constraints. Here, however, all the work is being done
within a single, never-violated constraint such as (2a).
Second, one wonders: what else can be stated in OT if this can? The constraints in (2) require several pages of a book chapter to specify. May a constraint
really incorporate any algorithm, no matter how complex or stipulative? If we say
yes, then OT can easily be used to describe unattested and presumably unlearnable languages. This would reduce OT to the status of an unfalsiﬁable descriptive
notation.
On this view, OT would make no claims of its own about universal grammar (UG), except for the weak claim that constraint ranking really is a mechanism
available to UG—alongside many more traditional mechanisms, such as iterative
footing and ordered rewrite rules, which may be expressed internal to a constraint
as in (2). Any other UG principles would have to be expressed independently of
the OT mechanism.
Such a theory should not be rejected out of hand. However, it would mean
that OT is not the radical new paradigm that one might expect, but rather a technical extension comparable to the introductionof cyclic rules (Mascar´ 1976). Much
o
linguistic work would have to remain focused on what happens within constraints,
rather than between constraints. In particular, what is the precise statement of each
complex constraint? How does such a statement of content vary diachronically or
typologically, other than by being reranked? Which details of the statement are
universal, and how is a language learner to induce the others?
Strategy B. Employ constraints such as FOOTFORM   to select foot shape,
ALIGN   for directionality of footing, and NONFINALITY for extrametricality.3
This type of account is standard in OT (for example, Cohn & McCarthy
1994). Yet on closer inspection, it is not too different from strategy A. It merely
breaks Hayes’s account into its superﬁcial elements: the three constraints of strategy B (FOOTFORM, ALIGN, and NONFINALITY) correspond respectively to the
three parameters of strategy A (foot shape, directionality, and extrametricality).
The account still does not crucially rely on one constraint’s forcing another to be
3 Introduced respectively by Prince (1990), McCarthy & Prince (1993), and Prince & Smolensky
(1993).

violated.4
Worse, while Strategy B has neater, smaller constraints than Strategy A,
perhaps we should still be concerned about what they say. A central issue of preOT phonology was how to limit the behavior of rules. Yet the constraints above
are not limited in any obvious way.
For example, it has frequently been asserted that UG allows only local
rules. Traditional accounts of metrical stress (Prince 1983, Halle & Vergnaud
1987, Kager 1993, Hayes 1995) respect locality: they employ an iterative footing
mechanism that has access to only a small, moving window of context. Yet the
directionality constraint ALIGN-L(F , PrWd) is decidedly non-local. It must measure the distance from each foot all the way to the edge of the word, and sum the
distances, and then minimize that sum.
FOOTFORM constraints are not as non-local as ALIGN constraints, but they
are more complex. Hayes (1995) argues from data such as (3) that while ^^
´
and — are acceptable iambs, ^— is preferred. This leads to the constraint in
´
´
(4) (see also Prince (1990)). But (4) is graded, conjunctive, and not entirely local
in that it must simultaneously evaluate conditions spanning the width of an entire
foot. Even the weaker constraint in (5), from Prince & Smolensky (1993), might
be suspect by pre-OT standards: as formulated, it must “count to 2,” rather than
just counting to “not one.”

Under strategy B, in short, a measure of simplicity and explanatory adequacy is lost in the move to OT, without changing the paradigm or explaining the
paradigmatic gaps.
Strategy C. Use only simple, local constraints, of a sort that is well-motivated by
phonological phenomena other than stress. Show that an appropriate choice of
such constraints will predict Hayes’s typology.
This strategy is the most radical—and the most attractive, provided that it
can be made to work. It is part of a broader program that attempts to nail down the
details of the OT formalism: to identify, once and for all, what sort of constraints
human grammars may use and what sort of representations they constrain. Such a
program would make OT into a complete, falsiﬁable formal framework in which
to write and process grammars.

x3 proposes such a formal framework. Only certain simple and extremely

local constraints are allowed: one cannot directly express STRESSSYSTEM, FOOTFORM, or ALIGN, just as one rightly cannot express “unnatural” constraints like
PALINDROMIC. x4–x10 show how this framework can account successfully for
even the metrical (and non-metrical) stress data.
Strategy C has an added bonus: it presses the linguist to construct explanatory grammars. Unlike Strategies A and B, the metrical account proposed
here does not merely stipulate Hayes’s typological asymmetries via complex constraints like FOOTFORM(Iamb), as these are disallowed. Rather, it shows the
metrical asymmetries to emerge from the onset-coda asymmetry and the preference for right-edge extrametricality.

OTP: Optimality Theory with Primitive constraints

To limit the families of constraints that OT grammars can enforce, we
ought to ask: What constraints have proved useful to date? Informal study of
the OT literature suggests that the same mechanisms are used over and over.
This section sketches OTP (Eisner 1997a, 1997b), a restricted version of OT that
schematizes these recurring mechanisms into two families of “primitive” constraints.
The implicationconstraint ! requires each to overlap temporally
with some . It assesses 1 violation for each that does not.
The corresponding clash constraint, denoted ? , prohibits each
from overlapping with any . It assesses 1 violation for each instance of overlap.
Thus, ! says ’s attract ’s, while ? says ’s repel ’s. These
primitive constraints are highly local, in that each violation results from some instantaneous phonological conﬁguration. The constraints state only what must be
present or absent at the moment an appears. But what is ? In each primitive
constraint, speciﬁes either the interior or an edge of a type of constituent—
which may in turn be prosodic ( ), articulatory (privative voi ), morphological
( Root ), or domain ([high-domain]). The same is true of .
While a full discussion is beyond the scope of this paper, very many
constraints can be directly expressed this way, as (6)–(7) illustrate. The uniform
notation highlights that the constraints have the same form.5

all surface voicing must be licensed by underlying voicing [cf. DEP-voi]

5 The English descriptions in (6)–(7) have less in common. A single constraint can admit of several
English descriptions: (6a) could have been written as “nas projects voi,” “voi licenses nas,” “every
nas aligns to a voi,” or “voicelesness is incompatible with nasality.”

Some comparisons may be helpful. The clash family ? is more
commonly notated *[ ; ], but this notation is unsuitable here because and
may themselves be written with brackets. The implication family ! resembles the Generalized Alignment or GA family (McCarthy & Prince 1993) in that
its constraints have the form 8 :9 :    and can align edges. However, it is both
more powerful than GA, in that and can be constituent interiors, not just edges,
and less powerful than GA, in that it does not measure the distance from to .
What are the representations? The primitive constraints control the relative timing of articulatory gestures, and other autosegmental constituents such
as syllables, along a continuous constituent timeline. Accordingly, the phonological forms are represented as in Optimal Domains Theory (Cole & Kisseberth
1994). All constituents have width; each type of constituent is on a separate
autosegmental tier. Constituents on the same tier may not overlap.

(8a) shows the OTP representation of /8k/. The association lines (Goldsmith 1976) of equivalent (8b) become unnecessary. Instead, constituents whose
interiors “overlap in time,” such as the velar gesture and either consonant of (8a),
are considered to be associated. Gen places constituents such as those in (8a)
freely along the continuous timeline, requiring only that edge brackets come in
matched pairs and that distinct constituents of the same type (e.g., two syllables or
two nas features) not overlap. Any other well-formedness conditions on bracket
placement, such as the prosodic hierarchy, are enforced not by Gen but by primitive constraints such as (6d) or perhaps the weaker (7d). This approach keeps
Gen simple. There is also empirical support for enforcing at least the prosodic
hierarchy with violable constraints (Selkirk 1994, Everett 1996).
In keeping with the principle of Containment (Prince & Smolensky 1993),
Gen includes all underlying (input) material in each candidate representation. This
material is placed on separate tiers (not shown in (8a)). Primitive constraints such
as (6g), (6h), and (7g) can then enforce Correspondence (represented as overlap)

between input constituents such as voi , notated with an underline, and phonetically interpretable output constituents such as voi .
Indeed, OTP representations constitute an implementation of Correspondence Theory, including McCarthy & Prince’s suggestions (1995, 18, 23) that
Correspondence should extend to handle autosegmental featural associations. In
OTP, Gen marks a candidate’s correspondent elements—input and output, segments and features, tones and tone-bearing units—not by coindexing them but by
having them overlap on the timeline. (A representational trick can make BaseReduplicant correspondences local in this way as well (Clements 1985, Eisner
1997a).)
In summary, the OTP framework is a particularly simple, local and uniform version of Optimality Theory—and Eisner (1997a) shows that it closely
matches the subset of OT used in practice. Working within OTP sharply limits
the space of grammars that the linguist or the language learner needs to consider.
The rest of this paper attempts to show that OTP can produce a ﬁne-grained,
explanatory account of the Hayesian stress typology.

Basic correspondences of syllables, feet, and stress marks

Let us begin by representing the basic facts about metrical feet, as any
theory of prosody must. The simple constraints in (9) establish prosodic-hierarchy
relations between feet F and syllables (Selkirk 1980a, 1980b, 1984). They put
basic restrictions on where feet must and must not appear.
(9) a. FILL-F : F

!

!

, F
(says where feet can appear)
“Each foot is strictly built from syllables: it starts and ends on syllable edges
(perhaps the edges of different syllables).”
b. PARSE- :
F
(says where feet must appear)
“Every syllable overlaps with (roughly, is ‘linked to’) some foot.”

!

For our purposes (9a) is undominated. (9b) is not actually used in the
analysis presented here, but it is a priori plausible and instructive to discuss. Notice that it permits sloppy parsing: it does not say that every syllable is wholly
contained in a foot.6 In conjunction with undominated (9a), however, it does have
that effect, as (9a) does not allow a syllable to be only partly footed. (It is therefore unnecessary to augment (9b) with ? F , ? F : “a foot may not start or
ﬁnish in mid- .”)
We may use (10) to identify trochaic stress with the left edge of a foot.
(For iambic stress, we would use the mirror image of (10), and similarly take the
mirror images of all other constraints that name a foot edge.) Note that stress is
necessarily treated as a phonological constituent, x. It has edges, width, and an
6 Sloppy parsing is useful in the analysis of spreading, where a surface feature overlaps the corresponding underlying feature but has a different width. See (6g), which requires only sloppy I-O
parsing but can be restricted by further constraints like (7g).

none of the primitive constraints could refer to it.7

(says where stress can appear)
“Stress only appears at the start of a foot.”
“Stress ends on a mora boundary, so extends over some integral number of

“Stress may not extend across (overlap with) a syllable boundary.”

With one exception, none of the constraints in (9)–(10) are crucially
dominated, that is, they are always observed on the surface (at least for typical
languages). Hence I will omit them in tableaux. The exception is (9b), PARSE(which, again, we will not actually need): it is often violated, e.g., in RL trochaic
 ´  ´ .
All these constraints are quite straightforward, but there is one noteworthy consequence of (10b), following Kager’s (1992) analysis of Estonian. In a
trochaic system, a stress mark [x] on a heavy syllable may either remain conﬁned
to the strong leftmost mora, or else spread to cover the whole syllable. These two
cases are illustrated in (11); where the distinction is important, they will be notated as ´ and ´ ´ respectively. (Note carefully that ´ ´ does not mean that there are
—
—
—
two x constituents on the stress tier, but rather one wide one.) The phonetic system is assumed to interpret these forms identically, and the universal constraints
given so far do not prefer one over the other.

(I follow Zec (1988) in assuming that a light syllable consists of a strong mora, s ,
while a heavy syllable consists of a strong mora followed by a weak mora, s w .)

In a moraic language, both forms of stress will appear: e.g., (17a:f) avoids
stress lapse by using both. However, syllabic stress languages show the inﬂuence
of a constraint SPREAD-x, which objects to ´ (11a) and prefers ´ ´. SPREAD-x
—

insists that a stress mark x should spread rightward to cover its entire syllable.
(12) SPREAD-x(trochaic): x

? w

“Stress shouldn’t end immediately before a weak mora (but may spread onto it).”

7 For symmetry, one can add the redundant constraints
x !  , x ? to trochaic (10b). Then
the only difference between the trochaic system and its iambic mirror image, so far, lies in the single
constraint x ! F . The rest of (9)–(10) is symmetric.

8

FOOTFORM Decomposed
SPREAD-x essentially says that stress has an afﬁnity for weak moras,
it is w that represents syllable weight. (While the
formulation in (12) may look odd at ﬁrst, it is the natural way to express local
spreading requirements in OTP; (7f) is another example.)

w —presumably because

How about iambic systems? They are the same, in mirror image: x may
either remain on the rightmost mora of —, written — or spread leftward to cover
´,
both moras. But spreading for iambs is never forced, as it is for syllabic trochees.
If it were, we would obtain the unattested case of syllabic (“even”) iambs. Why
does this not happen? Because stress already falls on the weak mora in iambic
languages: spreading it does not make it any happier. Neither SPREAD-x nor its
mirror image can distinguish between the iambic options, — and ´ ´.8
´
—
Thus, the desire of stress, x, to be supported by a weight-bearing mora,

w , leads to a difference between iambic and trochaic systems—the existence of
syllabic trochees but not syllabic iambs. In the next section we will see another
crucial constraint, WEIGHTEDGE, that is also motivated by this desire.
5.

Iambic systems and lapse avoidance

OTP offers at least two ways to ensure that a syllable string receives alternating stress. The word may either attract as many stresses as it can bear without
stress clash (i.e., ANTICLASH
STRESSALL), or endure only as few as it needs
to avoid stress lapse (i.e., ANTILAPSE
something like STRESSNONE). Either approach contrasts sharply with the non-OTP FTBIN account (see (5) above),
which does not make it clear why there can be no FTTERN or FTQUAT constraint.9
I will refer to these strategies as STRESSALL-driven and ANTILAPSEdriven, respectively, according to the constraint that drives the language to do
any footing at all. In this section and the next, I develop an ANTILAPSE-driven
typology. Later, x8 will examine the virtues of STRESSALL-driven systems.
A stress lapse consists of two successive unstressed syllables. Note that
no primitive constraint may refer directly to the absence of a stress mark x .
(Stress, like other OTP constituents, is privative; so this is just the common prohibition on reference to zeros (Stanley 1967, Akinlabi 1993).) Nonetheless, OTP
can successfully forbid lapse with the following local constraint:
8 To put this formally, (12) and its mirror image are satisﬁed on the surface for iambic systems.
Hence there is no harm done by adding either to a working hierarchy: it can’t eliminate the optimal
candidate. x ? w merely blocks ´ , which is already ruled out by FILL-x(iambic). Likewise,
—
´
—
´)
x ? w merely asks that ^ or ´ ´, which (unlike — start with stress, not follow a heavy syllable
s w , which ends in a weak mora. Again, other iambic constraints will independently enforce this
property.
9 Similar approaches for metrical stress have been advanced by Prince (1983), who writes that
“clash : : : is the major determinant of alternating patterns” (p. 73); by Selkirk (1984), who invokes a
constraint against lapses; and by Green & Kenstowicz (1995), whose foot-sensitive LAPSE constraint
is an embellishment of (13) and can similarly be expressed in OTP. McCarthy & Prince (1986, 1) propose that “a rule may ﬁx on one speciﬁed element and examine an structurally adjacent element and
no other.”

“Every syllable boundary coincides with the edge of a stress mark. That is,
adjacent syllables must contrast for stress.”

ANTILAPSE has a more complex statement than the other constraints in this paper. While conjunction and disjunction should be used reluctantly in OTP, they
are sometimes empirically necessary (e.g., to pick out the class of coronal fricatives or stressed vowels; see Eisner (1997a) for substantive restrictions). What is
crucial is that this machinery does not compromise the key requirement of OTP,
that each violation be triggered in a perfectly local manner. ANTILAPSE  simply targets those instants at which one syllable is ending and another starting, and
checks whether other edges fall at those instants.
Two other constraints complete the core of an ANTILAPSE-driven system. They deal with length, and in particular, with a phenomenon we saw earlier
in (12): the afﬁnity of stress for weak moras.

by a weak mora.”

(15) FILLWEIGHT: w

!S

or w



“Don’t lengthen: weak moras on the surface must correspond to underlying
segments or weak moras.10 ”

WEIGHTEDGE wants stressed syllables to be heavy. This obviously handles iambic lengthening; less obviously, it also helps to explain why heavy syllables are stressed.11 The idea is that stressing a heavy syllable is unobjectionable,
while stressing an underlyingly light syllable violates either WEIGHTEDGE (if we
lengthen the syllable) or else the faithfulness constraint FILLWEIGHT (if we do not
lengthen). To avoid such violations, we prefer to stress heavies. We will stress
(and perhaps lengthen) additional lights only to satisfy ANTILAPSE.
The three crucial constraints (13)–(15) may appear in any order. The resulting system depends only on which constraint is ranked lowest (and hence is
violated for the sake of the other two):
(16) a. ANTILAPSE , FILLWEIGHT
WEIGHTEDGE:
left-to-right iambs without IL (Seminole/Creek)
FILLWEIGHT:
b. ANTILAPSE , WEIGHTEDGE
left-to-right iambs with IL (Choctaw)
c. FILLWEIGHT , WEIGHTEDGE
ANTILAPSE:
stress heavies only, via unbounded right-strong feet (Kwakw’ala)
10 Compare the HEAD-DEP constraint of Alderete (1995), which bars epenthetic stressed vowels.
Strictly speaking, (15) should be accompanied by another constraint that checks the right edge of w
in the same way, since gemination is a method of lengthening, employed by Algonquian and other
languages, that never violates (15).
11 Contrast Prince (1990), Hung (1994), where weight-to-stress and iambic lengthening are unrelated.

FOOTFORM Decomposed
Like the bounded iambic systems, (16c) is—as one would hope—frequently attested. It is (16c) that combines with Prince’s (1983) End Rule (x10) to produce
quantity-sensitive unbounded stress systems (Prince 1976), such as Kwakw’ala,
which assigns primary stress to the leftmost heavy syllable.
The incomplete tableaux shown in (17) illustrate how the three systems
work. The STRESSALL constraint is discussed below. As is usual in OT, complete
tableaux are far too long to supply,12 but for all constraint hierarchies discussed in

c. Heavy stress. Other footings yielding these stresses are also ﬁne.
12 The tableau for (say) ^ —^^^—^ has 112,256 candidates, considering only those that satisfy both (9a) and the iambic version of (10), and whose only faithfulness violations involve syllable lengthening. Note that the underlying form is not really ^ —^^^—^ but something like
Mbumbababaranb. Gen does produce candidates with syllabiﬁcation or moraiﬁcation other than
^—^^^—^, but I assume these are always eliminated by higher-ranked constraints (i.e., syllabiﬁcation is not compromised to satisfy metrical requirements).

A low-ranked constraint, STRESSALL, is needed to break ties:
(18) STRESSALL:

! x (alternatively,

!

F or

!F

)

“Other things equal, have as many feet as possible (where feet and stresses are
in 1-1 correspondence).”

STRESSALL ensures that we will have stress wherever (13)–(15) do not actively
discourage it—in particular, on all heavy syllables. ANTILAPSE already begs for
stress on most heavy syllables (and in x6 we will see a moraic version that begs
for stress on all). However, we need STRESSALL to decide in favor of heavy stress
when ANTILAPSE is indifferent. For example, STRESSALL guarantees stress on
a word consisting of a lone heavy. It also stresses both of two successive heavies, choosing —— over alternatives such as *—´ ´, *— ´ ´, and *——, which
´ ´
—
—
´
satisfy (13)–(15) equally well. Such tie-breaking can be seen in (17a:h).
Note that unwanted clashing candidates such as (17a:e) tie with the usual
pattern of LR iambs (17a:f ). We easily eliminate such candidates with a further
mirroring constraint BRANCH, ranked anywhere, that rules out all degenerate feet
and thereby rules out stress clash. In general BRANCH seems to be inviolable, even
in cases (discussed in x10) commonly analyzed as having peripheral degenerate
feet. However, see footnote 17 for a possible use of the eliminated candidates.
(19) BRANCH(iambic): x

?

[compare the iambic version of (10)]
F
“Just as the right edge of an iambic foot insists on stress, the left edge absolutely
rejects it. Hence stress may not consume the entire foot, but must alternate.”

6.

Trochees with ANTILAPSE

To get RL syllabic trochees, we need only take the mirror image of the
iambic system. The key insight is that the trochaic mirror image of WEIGHTEDGE
must be violated for every foot, because the higher-ranked prosodic hierarchy
makes it impossible to satisfy:

12

FOOTFORM Decomposed
(20) WEIGHTEDGE(trochaic): F

! w

(alternatively, x

! w

)

“The stressed (left) edge of a foot should be supported by syllable weight, i.e.,
by a weak mora. [Thus, it must start in mid-s w  .]”

Put another way, speakers like to sustain the stressed end of a foot, but it is much
harder to do that for trochees. A trochaic version of (3) would not surface as
(ˇ c´ha)(bb´na)(ˇ c´li). Extra length w cannot be added at the left of a foot, nor is
cˇ ı
ı
cˇ ı
an underlying source of such length available to attract feet.
In syllabic trochee systems, therefore, WEIGHTEDGE ends up discouraging feet, and stresses, without regard to syllable quantity. This single change yields
the striking differences between iambs and syllabic trochees. We saw that while
iambic WEIGHTEDGE discouraged ´ in general, it turned a blind eye to —; trochaic
´
WEIGHTEDGE discourages all ´ . Thus iambic systems can stress adjacent heavy
syllables without violating WEIGHTEDGE, whereas for syllabic trochees, WEIGHTEDGE quite correctly objects to this. In addition, lengthening ^ lets it escape
´
WEIGHTEDGE’s notice in iambic systems, but not in trochaic ones—explaining the
absence of phonological Trochaic Lengthening.13
What trochaic systems do the possible rankings yield? If ANTILAPSE 
WEIGHTEDGE, we stress as many syllables as necessary to avoid lapse, but no
more. This results in bisyllabic feet, as desired: it takes fewer copies of  ´  than
of  ´  (e.g., ´ ) to cover a word. Syllabic stress is automatically preferred on
—
heavy syllables, since ANTILAPSE allows ´ ´  but not ´ . However, SPREAD-x
—
—
(ranked anywhere) is also needed—to break the tie between ^— and *^´ .

If on the other hand WEIGHTEDGE
ANTILAPSE  as in (16c), a
ranking that should be permitted for trochees because it is for iambs, then the optimal candidate has no feet at all. Fortunately, languages that stress nothing (or

everything) are indeed frequently attested: they are just languages without secondary stress contrasts. The constraints of x10 can still assign regular initial or
ﬁnal primary stress. Many such simple stress systems exist (see Hyman 1977).
Now let us turn to moraic trochees. They differ empirically from syllabic ones in that they avoid stress lapses not only between adjacent syllables, but
between any pair of adjacent moras. In particular, all heavy syllables must be
stressed, either as ´ or ´ ´, to avoid an internal lapse. We may produce a RL moraic

Note that even in these moraic trochee systems, syllabic stress ´ ´ may
—
surface, as in (23f). This is not due to the inﬂuence of SPREAD-x, which must be
universally ranked below ANTILAPSE and has no effect here. Rather, ANTILAPSE itself makes syllabic stress optimal on a heavy that precedes an odd string
of lights: candidate (f) is chosen over (g) or (c) to avoid lapse. This forces RL
footing, and achieves the attested RL stress pattern, though via a non-Hayesian
analysis—the “mirror iamb” ´ ´^. The footing exactly mirrors the iambic sys—
tem of (17a), where lapse avoidance resulted in the syllabically-stressed, Hayesian
iamb ^´ ´ and a LR stress pattern.
—
We have now seen that the same system yields syllabic or moraic trochees
according to the choice of ANTILAPSE  or ANTILAPSE, and that the mirror
of the ANTILAPSE  version yields iambs. We must also consider the mirror of
the ANTILAPSE version: is it attested? The answer turns out to be yes: it too
is iambic. That is, for the iambic systems in (16), the choice between the two
versions of ANTILAPSE makes absolutely no difference.14

should this be? Kager (1993) observes that if we consider only surface stress, leaving aside

7.

An iambic lengthening paradox, and LR trochees

The system of x5–x6 is typologically attractive in that if we freely
rank the constraints (13)–(19) or their mirror images, and optionally substitute
ANTILAPSE for ANTILAPSE , we derive exactly the following systems:
LR iambs with and without lengthening
unbounded stress systems that stress all heavy syllables
RL syllabic and moraic trochees
simple degenerate systems without a secondary stress contrast
(ranking STRESSALL high stresses everything; ranking WEIGHTEDGE(trochaic)
high stresses nothing)
However, there are two deﬁciencies in the system as stated. First, to secure the
above result, we must resolve a ranking paradox involving iambic lengthening.
Second, the typology does not yet generate LR trochees.
The facts of LR iambic lengthening languages such as Choctaw present
a curious ranking paradox. Example (24a) suggests that rather than leave a stray
light syllable, the word is willing to suffer both a faithfulness violation (lengthening) and a possibly suboptimal foot —. The desire to foot the stray ^ is
´
apparently ranked high enough to overcome these obstacles.15
(24)

´ ´
Output: *—
´
Output: *^——
´ ´

*^^—
´
^
^—^
´

But given such a preference, why is the same decision not made in (24b–c)?
Shouldn’t the phonology again prefer to lengthen and foot the stray syllable—
at the same cost, namely, one additional lengthened syllable and one suboptimal
—?
´
The ANTILAPSE-driven approach above provides a partial explanation:
stray syllables are footed only as necessary to avoid a stress lapse. (24a) is a case
where lengthening is worthwhile because it avoids a lapse. No lapse is at issue in
(24b–c), whose winning candidates are lapse-free despite their stray syllables.
lengthening and the conﬂicting theoretical claims about foot shape (e.g., mirror iambs) and position,
LR iambs are perfect mirrors of RL moraic trochees. So it should not be surprising that moraic
trochees (with ANTILAPSE) mirror to an iambic system. As for syllabic trochees, they differ from
moraic ones only because ANTILAPSE  does not demand that heavy syllables be stressed, while
ANTILAPSE does. This difference has no observable effect in the iambic mirror image, where
WEIGHTEDGE(iambic) and STRESSALL stress heavies even without help from ANTILAPSE.
15 One might wonder whether it is instead a (non-primitive) Generalized Alignment constraint that
selects ^—— over *^^—. The answer is no: both ALIGN-L(F ,PrWd) and ALIGN-R(F ,PrWd)
´ ´
´
incorrectly favor *^^—.
´

15

Jason M. Eisner
However, this explanation leaves a residue. It does not explain why
´ ´
´
´
(24a) chooses ^—— over yet another candidate, *—^—. Under rankings
like (16b), these two choices simply tie. For a longer example, consider underlying
^^^^—^^. No local well-formedness constraint can distinguish between the
candidates ^—^——^— and *^——^—^—, which are apparently
´
´ ´
´
´ ´
´
´
identical on the surface except for the order of two word-internal feet.
One, rather arbitrary solution is to introduce a low-ranked, non-local constraint just to break the tie: ALIGN-RF; PrWd  or ALIGN-R—; PrWd . Such
constraints are not allowed within the OTP framework. It seems a pity to add
them for such a small role. Nor can they play a big role: these data simply do not
yield to an GA-style account. Adopting alignment wholesale would mean ranking
ALIGN-L highly in order to explain LR footing (consider (24c), which surfaces as
^—^ not *^^—); but this would sabotage the tie-breaker ALIGN-R.
´
´
A second line of attack supposes that these two candidates are not in
fact identical on the surface—that “added” length is phonologically distinct from
“parsed” length. Hayes (1995, p. 269) remarks that when both types of length
exist in an IL language, they are sometimes phonetically distinct (Choctaw, Chickasaw, St. Lawrence Island Yupik). If the system were modiﬁed to represent two
types of length, we could ban just those surface — feet that are “underlyingly de´
generate”: well-formedness constraints could recognize them as ^ feet padded
´
with length of the merely “added” variety. (Such — feet are blocked similarly in
´
´
derivational accounts, where they can only arise if degenerate ^ can be created
before lengthening applies (Hayes 1985, 1995, Kager 1993).)
A third solution, adopted here, is to go beyond well-formedness constraints and use a local input-output (I-O) constraint, SUPPORT-x. Again, the idea
is to state that — is a bad foot just if it corresponds to underlying ^. Such bad
´
feet never surface in IL systems or indeed in any system (except to rescue subminimal words), so SUPPORT-x may be ranked arbitarily high; on the other hand, it is
presently only needed to break ties, so lower rankings will work equally well.

In particular, — violates SUPPORT-x just in lengthened cases like (26), where the
´
stress mark rests entirely on epenthetic material—the second half of a lengthened
vowel or the ﬁrst half of a geminated consonant. ´ ´ is not a possible alterna—
tive: while the wider stress mark does satisfy SUPPORT-x, it is already ruled out
by BRANCH. The iambic feet ^^, ^´ ´ (even when lengthened from ^^), and
´
—
non-lengthened — survive both constraints.
´

16

FOOTFORM Decomposed
Notice that while (25) is an I-O constraint, it is not strictly a faithfulness constraint. Nor can it be: faithfulness cannot distinguish the candidates in
the ^^^^—^^ case above, each of which lengthens just one syllable. McCarthy & Prince (1994, p. 22) speculate that I-O constraints may exist that do
not resemble faithfulness, and there are precedents for this. For example, Cole
& Kisseberth (1994) do not parse underlying ATR into surface ATR (ATR ! ATR),
but rather into another, phonetically invisible constituent called an “ATR domain”
(ATR ! ATRdom); and several authors have proposed ﬁnely-tuned “positional
faithfulness” constraints that are sensitive to local prosody (e.g., Steriade 1995,
McCarthy 1995, Lombardi 1995).16
A more serious problem with the ANTILAPSE-driven approach of x5–x6
is directionality. The ANTILAPSE-driven approach correctly predicts that all iambs
are LR. However, it also predicts that all trochees are RL, which is patently false.
To see what is odd about the well-attested case of LR trochees, deﬁne an
alignment domain or ADom to be a maximal string of ^’s (the moraic case) or
simply of ’s (the syllabic case). To get LR trochees, we must actually force a lapse
at the right end of every odd-length alignment domain: ´ ^ or ´ ^^^´ 
—
— ´
—
(moraic),  ´  ´  (syllabic). By contrast, an even-length alignment domain is
exhaustively footed: ´ ^^^^´ .
— ´
´
—
There are various adjustments that can force LR trochees over the objections of ANTILAPSE. One approach is to add constraints to the existing hierarchy.
(For example, something like ADom ! F or ADom ! x would attempt to
restart footing at the left edge of an alignment domain, while ADom ? F , discussed below, would break ties by encouraging any resulting lapse to fall at the
right edge of the domain rather than in the middle.17 ) A related approach involves
16 Another interesting example of a necessary non-faithfulnessI-O constraint is provided by Trochaic
Shortening, provided that this occurs (as Hayes would predict) with LR (not just RL) moraic trochees:

(i) a. Underlying ^^^^^  surface ^^ ^^ ^
´
´
b. Underlying ^^^—^  surface ^^^^^
´
´

^^^^^
´
´
^^ ^^^ 
´
´

The faithfulness constraints PARSEWEIGHT and FILLWEIGHT do not distinguish the candidates either
in (a) or in (b). Thus, if these are the only I-O constraints available, it must be a well-formedness (O)
constraint that breaks the tie in each case. But this is impossible, for the highest-ranked O constraint to
distinguish ^^^^^ from ^^^^^ would break both the ties in favor of the same output.
´
´
´
´
We must conclude that other I-O constraints are available. These could be faithfulness constraints,
since we could stress all heavy syllables in the lexicon and just use PARSESTRESS: x ! x. Such
a lexical redundancy rule would complicate the learning problem, however, and barring it we appear to need a non-faithfulness I-O constraint. We might say that underlying length projects surface
stress (e.g., w ! x), or that it is more important to parse it at the weak edge of a foot (e.g.,
 w and F  ! w ).
17 It is an intriguing possibility that in iambic systems, the same (unmirrored) constraint
ADom ! x
might be responsible for the unusual stress systems of T¨ batulabal, Aklan, and Tiberian Hebrew.
u
Kager (1989) shows that these systems can be analyzed as moraic trochees plus ﬁnal main stress.
Other analyses (Crowhurst 1991, Kager 1993), suggest that they are RL iambic—an otherwise unattested case—but allow degenerate feet at the left edge of each alignment domain, in part to avoid
lapse: —^^^ —^ rather than *—^^^—^. Both analyses are possible for us:
´ ´
´ ´ ´
´
´ ´
the former may be arranged as in x10, while the latter emerges as candidate (17a:d) if BRANCH and
WEIGHTEDGE are dominated by ADom ! x .

such as  !  x or x ), that does not have a RL directionality preference.
In the next section, we will examine a more interesting and perhaps neater
approach that relies on more freely reranking the constraints of x5–x6.

Driving LR trochees and more with STRESSALL

The central proposal of this section is that both LR trochees and ﬁnalsyllable extrametricality result from an undominated NONFINALITY constraint:
(27) NONFINALITY: ADom

?

F

“The rightmost syllable of an alignment domain may not be footed.”

The effect of this constraint will depend on where ADom constituents are constrained to appear (possibly nowhere). I assume that NONFINALITY does not
mirror—that it takes exactly the form in (27) for both iambic and trochaic systems. In this respect, it resembles ordinary universal constraints such as ONSET
and NOCODA. It does not class with the other asymmetric constraints proposed
in this paper: FILL-F , BRANCH, WEIGHTEDGE, and (optionally) SPREAD-x. (Perhaps this is because it is not involved in foot form, or because it does not mention
x.)
An asymmetry like this is necessary in any system, to account for the
fact that extrametrical syllables are overwhelmingly word-ﬁnal. (Hayes (1995,
74) writes that the only well-motivated exception is Kashaya (Buckley 1991).)
Provided that NONFINALITY causes extrametricality, its inability to mirror simply
states this asymmetry.
We will see shortly that NONFINALITY has a second effect: it can favor
LR footing. Its inability to mirror therefore makes a second prediction—the absence of RL iambs. As we will see, ANTILAPSE and NONFINALITY simply concur
that iambs should be LR. For trochees, by contrast, they compete to enforce RL
and LR respectively. The absence of RL iambs is of course a serious problem for
parametric accounts of directionality, whether iterative (Hayes 1995) or based on
Generalized Alignment (McCarthy & Prince 1993).
Unifying these two asymmetries—extrametricality and directionality—is
not mere sophistry. There is a powerful reason to use the same constraint NONFINALITY to explain both LR trochaism and ﬁnal syllable extrametricality: namely,
these properties appear to be in complementary distribution. Hayes (1995) lists
32 trochaic languages that are LR, and 21 trochaic languages with ﬁnal-syllable
extrametricality, yet there is no overlap. In particular, no language assigns preantepenultimate stress on even strings,  ´  ´  h i, but not on odd strings,
 ´  ´ h i.18
18 Preantepenultimate main stress is not empirically impossible, so long as its position (relative to
the right edge) is unaffected by string length. For the several cases of this sort, Hayes uses RL trochees

18

FOOTFORM Decomposed
Again, this is a serious gap for the parametric accounts (and to my knowledge, one that has not been pointed out before). LR iterative footing (or ALIGN-L)
should combine easily with right extrametricality (or PrWd ? F ). Indeed, these
properties do combine in the iambic case, speciﬁcally in Hixkaryana and Asheninca (Hayes 1995, 288, 206). Yet they never combine for trochees.
The gap is immediately predicted by the present system, in which the
complementary phenomena result from the same local constraint. To achieve the
double stray at the end of  ´  ´  h i, NONFINALITY would have to keep feet
off the last two syllables—one for extrametricality, and one for the LR lapse. But
NONFINALITY is merely a local constraint. It can push feet away from the end of
the word, but (unlike ALIGN-L) it cannot inﬂuence how far they are pushed. In
particular, it is just as satisﬁed by the RL candidate,  ´  ´ h i—which then
wins because it violates ANTILAPSE only once.
Having motivated the approach, let us turn to the details of the system.
A key property of LR footing is that it sometimes overrides whatever mechanism C blocks footing of the ﬁnal syllable (assuming there is such a mechanism).
Speciﬁcally, on even-length alignment domains,  ´  ´  is exhaustively footed.
This suggests that STRESSALL
C . Extrametricality, by contrast, requires C
STRESSALL so that the ﬁnal syllable is always unfooted:  ´  .
If this analysis is correct (rather than the suggestions in x7), LR trochees
require what x5 called a STRESSALL-driven hierarchy. We just saw that LR
trochees require STRESSALL
C to prevent lapses on even-length alignment
domains. They also need C
ANTILAPSE to override the preference for RL
trochees. Therefore STRESSALL
ANTILAPSE. This yields a STRESSALLdriven approach, in contrast to the ANTILAPSE-driven approach of x5–x6.

At the start of x7, I mentioned in passing that we could freely rerank
the proposed constraints and still get attested systems. For example, some languages might be STRESSALL-driven while others are ANTILAPSE-driven. Which
are the systems generated when STRESSALL is highly ranked—speciﬁcally, when
STRESSALL
WEIGHTEDGE, meaning that the desire to add stresses outranks
the desire to suppress them?
Such rankings yield either simple degenerate systems, where STRESSALL
forces every syllable to be stressed, or new ways of generating iambs and trochees.
Iambs and trochees arise again if STRESSALL is not given a free hand to stress
everything: rankings with BRANCH
STRESSALL force alternating stress.19
For example, if BRANCH and SUPPORT-x are undominated, the results of (17) and
(23) can be perfectly reproduced by exchanging the positions of STRESSALL and
ANTILAPSE. The case corresponding to (17a) is shown below.
(28) LR iambs without lengthening: STRESSALL-driven version.

Now let us consider how NONFINALITY affects these STRESSALL-driven
systems. If there are no ADom constituents, or if their placement is not affected
by sufﬁciently high-ranked constraints, then NONFINALITY will have no effect. I
suggest the following constraints to control the placement of alignment domains:
(29) FILL-ADom: ADom

! ,
! ADom

ADom

!

“An alignment domain consists of one or more syllables.”

(30) ADOMINCLUDE:

“Every syllable must be parsed into an alignment domain. (Roughly, alignment
domains should be maximal.)”

(31) ADOMEXCLUDE:

ADom ? w

“Alignment domains are interrupted by weak moras (hence by heavy syllables).”

FILL-ADom is undominated (as is NONFINALITY). The ranking of ADOMINCLUDE governs where alignment domains are created, and thereby determines
where undominated NONFINALITY holds sway. Consider for example the following rankings, in a moraic trochee language:
(32) a. ADOMINC
STRESSALL
ADOMEXC
ANTILAPSE:
RL with right extrametr. (one ADom covers whole word20)
b. STRESSALL
ADOMINC
ADOMEXC
ANTILAPSE:
an unattested system similar to (32d); described below
c. STRESSALL
ADOMEXC
ADOMINC
ANTILAPSE:
LR (a separate ADom covers each string of light syllables)
d. STRESSALL
ADOMEXC
ANTILAPSE
ADOMINC:
RL (foot placement determined entirely by ANTILAPSE;
ADom(s) fall where they may)
20 To rank ADOMINCLUDE highly is to allow only candidates that are fully parsed into alignment
domains. ADOMINCLUDE is equally happy with one long ADom or several abutting narrow ones.
However, no constraint in (32a) actively prefers, say, f gf g to f
g, so we may safely ignore the multiple-abutting-ADom candidates: they are never more optimal than their corresponding
single-ADom candidates, although they may tie.

20

FOOTFORM Decomposed
ANTILAPSE still forces RL footing in (32), except as overridden. Note that (32) reADOMEXCLUDE, which ensures that
spects the universal ranking STRESSALL
we do not get a word-internal analogue of extrametricality (i.e., ﬁnal lapse on every
ADom, so *´ ´^^^^— beats ´ ^^^^—). For if ADOMINCLUDE is
—
´
´
— ´
´
´
ranked highly enough to reduce the number of feet, i.e. above STRESSALL, then it
will also outrank ADOMEXCLUDE. The word can then be covered with one ADom,
so NONFINALITY need force only a word-ﬁnal lapse.
9.

Free reranking, and mora-stacking languages

Like other constraints we have seen, those in x8 can be reranked quite
freely. Not only are ANTILAPSE-driven rankings (17), (23) attested as well
as STRESSALL-driven rankings such as (28), but we can see, for instance, that
ADOMEXCLUDE could be lowered without effect in (32a,d).
Consider what happens if we freely rerank all the moraic trochee constraints that are ever violated, shown in (33), except that reranking is subject to
universal (34):
(33) STRESSALL, ANTILAPSE, WEIGHTEDGE, FILLLENGTH, ADOMINCLUDE,
ADOMEXCLUDE, ADom ? F
(34) a. STRESSALL
ADOMEXCLUDE. [No word-internal extrametricality.]
b. FILLLENGTH
STRESSALL. [Bars debatable degenerate systems.21 ]
c. FILLLENGTH
ADom ? F . [Or unneeded ADom’s may have power.22 ]
Everything in (33) is of course to be outranked by the undominated constraints
discussed earlier, and by BRANCH and SUPPORT-x. If we also assume the universal
restrictions in (34), then an exhaustive check by computer conﬁrms that precisely
the desired moraic trochee systems are generated, plus a single unattested system,
(32b). (This system is just like RL footing, but if the word contains any odd light
strings, the rightmost one of these is footed LR.)
21 A language can simultaneously satisfy STRESSALL and BRANCH without alternating stress, by
—
lengthening every syllable to ´ . (34b) is designed to prevent such languages. Another way to prevent them would be a version of SUPPORT-x that disallowed underlyingly degenerate trochees ´  as
—
well as iambs —: one possibility (under certain representational assumptions) is F ! V .
´
—
— ` ` `
What would a language that lengthened everything to ´  look like? Answer: ´ — — — or
— — — ´ , assuming that primary stress is assigned by End Rule Left or End Rule Right (x10). These
` ` ` —
are just simple languages with no stress or length contrast; they would not pose a problem for our theory. However, with ADOMINCLUDE
STRESSALL, extrametricality allows two more (unattested)
— ` `
` ` —
possibilities: ´ — —^ and — — ´ ^. It is possible that such languages do exist, but that the wordﬁnal relaxation has been misdiagnosed as a phonetic effect. If so, (34b) could be eliminated, and the
resulting languages would simply reproduce an old typological observation (at least for quantity-free
languages): Hyman (1977) counts 114 languages where main stress regularly falls in initial position,
77 and 97 where it is penultimate or ultimate, and only 12 where it is regularly peninitial.
22 The constraint
ADom ? F is needed somewhere to break ties: for example, if (32c) lacks this
constraint, then f´ ^^ ^g´  ties with *f´ ^^ ^g—, where f g denotes an ADom. But
— ´
—
— ´
´
it must not be ranked above FILLLENGTH, or it can distort the shape of a word even in systems, like
(32d), where we expect ADom’s to be irrelevant. To mention one example, if (32d) continues with “  
FILLLENGTH,” then on input ^^, f^g´  wins rather than f^g^.

´
ADom ? F

Moreover, as one would hope, the mirror images of these moraic trochee
hierarchies generate precisely the iambic and unbounded systems of (16), plus
versions of these systems with right extrametricality. All these are attested. It
must however be noted that for the LR iambic systems with extrametricality
(rare: Hixkaryana and the much more complicated Asheninca), these constraints
´
´
do not sufﬁce to resolve the foot placement tie between, e.g., ^^^^^^,
*^^^^^^, and *^^^^^^, each of which has just one lapse.
´
´
´
´
The third and ﬁnal case—syllabic trochees—is at ﬁrst blush more difﬁcult. If we allow STRESSALL-driven systems (see the end of x7 above for alternatives), syllabic trochees appear to be parametrically different from moraic ones.
To obtain them from (33)–(34), while blocking unattested systems, three changes
are necessary. First, ANTILAPSE  replaces ANTILAPSE, as in x6. Second, the
quantity-sensitive ADOMEXCLUDE must vanish from the hierarchy (or stay below
ADOMINCLUDE). Third, SPREAD-x must appear at the top of the hierarchy (above
STRESSALL and ADOMINCLUDE).23
The resulting hierarchies do generate exactly RL syllabic trochees with
and without extrametricality, LR syllabic trochees, and systems without secondary
stress contrasts. But why should the above three changes be triggered by a single
parameter? Why are there no mixed systems, that combine, say, ANTILAPSE 
with ADOMEXCLUDE? Or more descriptively: why do several trochaic languages
(such as Pintupi; Hayes (1995, 102) lists others) behave in all metrical respects as
if all syllables were light, but show quantity-sensitivity elsewhere in the grammar?
I suggest, tentatively, that the difference lies not in the metrical theory but
in the moraiﬁcation theory—that is, in a subhierarchy of syllable structure constraints universally ranked above (33). The idea is that all languages use exactly
the constraints in (33), but that some languages happen to represent heavy syllables
not as in Zec’s (1988) (35a) but as in (35b).24 The less common (35b) languages
look like Pintupi if trochaic, but like ordinary iambic languages if iambic.

In mora-stacking languages, the strong mora itself is spread over any
weak mora; s becomes coextensive with . Because stress must start and end on
mora boundaries (FILL-x), trochaic stress (anchored at the left of the syllable) must
cover the entire syllable. By contrast, iambic stress is not forced to be syllabic
under (35b) any more than under (35a): it may cover either w or s .
23 While SPREAD-x was also used in the ANTILAPSE-driven systems of x6, it was more comfortably
assumed to appear in all systems (but ranked so low that it was inert except for syllabic trochees).
24 Such a difference would not be hard to arrange formally. For example, it might be governed by
the relative ranking of the clash constraint s ? w , which favors (35a), and the spreading constraint
s ? w , which favors (35b).

22

FOOTFORM Decomposed
We can now, ﬁrst, dispense with SPREAD-x: all mora-stacking languages, both iambic and trochaic, already place stress precisely as an undominated
SPREAD-x would require. Second, we can eliminate ANTILAPSE , because morastacking languages respond to ANTILAPSE just as they would have responded
to ANTILAPSE : this is because ANTILAPSE targets mora boundaries  , and
here these appear just at syllable boundaries. Finally, we must explain why morastacking languages would be insensitive to ADOMEXCLUDE, as if a string of heavy
and light syllables contained no weak moras. Observe that for such a language,
such a string at least is not interrupted by its weak moras. If we restate ADOMEXCLUDE as (36), it will have unchanged effect for mora-chaining languages but no
effect for mora-stacking languages:
(36) ADOMEXCLUDE:

ADom and



s 

! s

“Within an alignment domain, every s is immediately followed by another s
without interruption.”

To summarize the whole system, the rather free primitive constraint rankings of (33)–(34) generate just the attested patterns for moraic trochees (plus unattested (32b)) in mora-chaining languages, and just the attested patterns for syllabic
trochees in mora-stacking languages. The mirror-image constraints give just the
attested patterns for iambic and unbounded languages, for both mora-chaining and
mora-stacking languages. What appear to be parametric gaps or asymmetries, in
a theory like Hayes (1995), emerge gracefully from the fact that the constraint in
(27) and the syllable structures in (35) do not mirror.
10.

Word-level stress and degenerate feet

Up till this point, we have been considering only one level of stress—
what Liberman (1975) called level-1 stress on the metrical grid. The level-1
stress mark x falls on prosodic units that bear (at least) secondary stress. We
now turn to the optimization of primary or level-2 stress, which appears just on
a word’s main stressed syllable. In OTP, we represent level-2 stress as a further
constituent type, X, which is universally constrained to span the width of a single
syllable (say).
In Liberman (1975), the grid is taken to be inherently scalar: every X is
supported by a x, as shown in (37). We may formulate this property in OTP via
the constraint (38).

x

x

(37)  `  `  ´  =
(38) CONTINUOUSCOLUMN: X

! x.

Prince (1983) proposes a two-step process: ﬁrst, secondary stresses are
assigned metrically, and second, an End Rule strengthens the leftmost or rightmost
of these into a primary stress. One may straighforwardly transport this account

23

Jason M. Eisner
into a constraint-based framework as follows. The constraints described earlier in
the paper ﬁx the position of level-1 stress. Lower-ranked constraints then winnow
the remaining candidates to those that optimize the position of level-2 stress.
We will need another universal constituent type to implement this End
Rule: call it a X-domain (XDom). (New OTP constituents should not be invented
lightly; this one is justiﬁed by the universality of the phenomenon.) Primary stress
appears at the left edges of X-domains and nowhere else, owing to undominated
constraints (39a). Just as the left edge of XDom corresponds precisely to primary
stress, the right edge of an XDom corresponds precisely to the end of a word, owing to undominated (39b). Since each prosodic word has exactly one PrWd , it
follows that each word will have exactly one XDom and one X. This is the principle
of culminativity.

I propose that the realization of the End Rule depends on the relative
ranking of three violable constraints, two of which are converses of each other:
(40) a. SHORT-XDom:

XDom ?

“A word’s X-domain should contain as few syllables as possible, so that X (at
the left edge of XDom) falls as far right as possible.”

! XDom
XDom-SOME-x: XDom ! x

b. XDom-ALL-x: x

“A word’s X-domain should cover all secondary stresses in the word.”

c.

(alternatively, XDom

“A word’s X-domain should cover at least one secondary stress.”

!

x)

The six possible rankings of these constraints yield just three patterns:
(41) a. SHORT-XDom is ranked highest: The XDom remains as short as possible—
namely, on the ﬁnal syllable alone. Primary stress therefore prefers to
be word-ﬁnal. This case is further discussed below.
b. XDom-ALL-x
SHORT-XDom: The XDom stretches leftward to cover
all secondary stresses, yielding End Rule Left. If there are no secondary
stresses,25 then stress remains ﬁnal. Thus we have an “opposite-side
default” version of End Rule Left (Prince 1985), as in Kwakw’ala.
(^ —^^—^ XDom , ^^^^^ ^ XDom )
´
`
´
c. SHORT-XDom
XDom-ALL-x but XDom-SOME-x
SHORT-XDom:
The XDom stretches leftward to cover just the rightmost secondary stress,
yielding End Rule Right. If higher-ranked constraints allow no secondary stresses, then XDom-SOME-x cannot be satisﬁed and stress again
remains ﬁnal; so we have a “same-side default” version of End Rule
`
´
´
Right, as in Aguacatec. (^—^^ —^ XDom , ^^^^^ ^ XDom )
25 As may happen in unbounded stress systems (16c) when no heavy syllables are present, or in
systems with no secondary stress constrast, as discussed at the start of x7.

24

FOOTFORM Decomposed
To obtain other logically possible systems, simply replace the XDom-edge constraints in (39) with their mirror images. This yields, respectively, regular initial
primary stress, End Rule Right with opposite-side default, and End Rule Left with
same-side-default.26
Not only does this approach work for assigning primary stress in standard
bounded and unbounded systems like those in (16), it also adapts well to more
complex cases. Kelkar’s (1968) Hindi is a variant of (41c) where primary stress
assignment recognizes not two but three levels of prominence. These levels are
deﬁned by syllable weight (^; —; =) rather than secondary stress. Primary stress
falls on one of the most prominent syllables; in the event of a tie, the rightmost
nonﬁnal such syllable is chosen. To obtain this variation, simply replace highestranked XDom-SOME-x in (41c) with a prominence subhierarchy that is sensitive
to edges, and a weak constraint against ﬁnal primary stress, to obtain:
(42) XDom

!=
X ? PrWd

XDom

!—

SHORT-XDom

!^
XDom-ALL-x

XDom

For a complex case involving bounded rather than unbounded systems,
consider cases of foot extrametricality (Hayes 1995, 105–108) as found in several Arabic dialects. Here a word-ﬁnal foot is ignored by End Rule Right. The
simplest solution posits (41c) plus a primitive constraint XDom ! F , which
requires the X-domain to stretch far enough left that its interior crosses a foot
boundary. As for syllables, no extrametrical material need be explicitly marked.
The solution correctly predicts that the rightmost foot will not be ignored if is not
word-ﬁnal (e.g., if it is followed by a stray syllable or even an extrasyllabic consonant, as in Arabic dialects and Stoney Dakota: optimal ^^— XDom and
´
`
^^ —C XDom ).
`
´
Let us now turn to the ranking (41a), and assume the mirror images of
(39). The primary-stress constraint SHORT-XDom would like initial stress here, but
the constraints that assign secondary stress may have other plans. Hayes (1995,
116–118) provides a helpful example: moraic trochees (23) will strongly disfavor secondary stress on the ﬁrst syllable of ^—. If the ﬁrst syllable is stressed, as
(41a) wants, then the system cannot stress the second syllable without violating
undominated BRANCH, or leave it unstressed without violating ANTILAPSE.
If primary stress wins this conﬂict (SHORT-XDom
ANTILAPSE), then
we have what Hayes calls top-down stressing: Old English ^ — is the optimal
´
candidate, where
denotes the XDom. Here SHORT-XDom and CONTINUOUSCOLUMN conspire to allow only candidates with initial secondary stress, and then
BRANCH prefers the lapsed form ^— to ^—. But if secondary stress wins
`
` `
the conﬂict (ANTILAPSE
SHORT-XDom), then we have Hayes’s bottom-up
stressing: Malayalam ^— . Here the XDom has been forced to cover both

Cahuilla

There is, however, a third option, shown in (43c) and attested in Cahuilla. I
will suggest that so-called degenerate feet can be analyzed via violations of
CONTINUOUSCOLUMN—an apparently rigid constraint that like the prosodic hierarchy may actually be violable (Selkirk 1994, Everett 1996).
Languages such as Auca (syllabic trochees) apparently allow degenerate
feet at word edge:  `  ´ ,  `  `  ´ . One analysis is that the language simply ﬁts in another stress mark if it can: e.g., it is STRESSALL-driven, and BRANCH
is replaced with a less restrictive constraint ANTICLASH, x ? x .27 However,
word-edge degenerate feet sometimes appear even in clash positions, as in Cahuilla
^—^^. So we need a more complete account of degeneracy.
´ ` `
Hayes (1995) makes the interesting proposal that some languages disallow degenerate feet entirely (strong prohibition), while others, like Auca and
Cahuilla, allow them just if they bear primary stress X (weak prohibition). For
example, Cahuilla and Old English are both LR moraic languages with obligatory initial stress (presumably due to PrWd ! X ). However, Cahuilla allows
degenerate ^—    (weak prohibition) where Old English apparently requires
´ `
the awkward but non-degenerate trochee ^—    (strong prohibition).
´
We may reformulate Hayes’s proposal as follows. Degenerate feet never
exist (BRANCH is inviolable); in the weak-prohibition languages, primary stress X
simply does not project a foot. After all, the stress-to-foot constraints in (10b),
FILL-x, mention only x. Thus, Cahuilla is really ^—   , which gives the ap´ `
pearance of a degenerate foot but in truth does not violate BRANCH. The strong
prohibition in languages like Old English results from the CONTINOUSCOLUMN
constraint above. This makes primary stress X project a (phonetically redundant)
secondary stress mark x, which in turn requires a foot via FILL-x. Then ^— is the
´
only way to make this foot satisfy BRANCH. The insight is that strong-prohibition
languages allow the placement of primary stress to affect the assigment of feet or
27 A variation on this theme is to allow the last foot to overhang the edge of the word –an event
known as catalexis (Kiparsky 1991, Green 1995, Kager 1995):

secondary stress. Such an effect is possible just if some constraint that relates X to
x such as CONTINUOUSCOLUMN, is ranked highly.

Conclusions

We have now considered a wide range of stress phenomena that are
predicted by a single coherent system: Hayesian foot form, quantity sensitivity,
unbounded stress, simple word-initial and word-ﬁnal stress, iambic lengthening,
directionality of footing, syllable (and foot) extrametricality, degenerate feet, and
word-level stress, including prominence-based systems. (I have not addressed
ternary rhythm, Trochaic Shortening, or the residue from Alignment.)
The metrical part of the account rests on the following intuitions: (a)
iambs are special because they can lengthen their strong ends in a way recognized by syllable structure; (b) directionality of footing is really the result of local
lapse avoidance; (c) any lapses are forced by a (localist) generalization of right extrametricality; (d) although degenerate feet are absolutely banned, primary stress
does not require a foot in all languages. An interesting prediction of (b) and (c)
is that left-to-right trochees should be incompatible with extrametricality. This
prediction is robustly conﬁrmed in Hayes.
The work is of interest for several reasons. For readers who are interested in comparing Optimality Theory with derivational theories, it is useful to
know that OT can provide an interesting and rather accurate cross-linguistic typology of a complex phenomenon, and that the typology is in fact quite different
in spirit from a careful derivational typology of the same data (Hayes 1995).
For readers who are concerned about the potentially unlimited power of
OT mechanisms, it is a welcome and perhaps surprising result that these complex
data can be modeled comfortably with the extremely simple, local, and independently motivated “primitive constraints” of OTP (x3). Indeed, the primitive
constraints appear to have provided building blocks of the correct granularity, in
that the ones used here can—and must—be reranked quite freely to get just the
desired systems. This result appears to be technically sound, in that the very
large tableaux resulting from these rerankings have all been checked thoroughly
by computer.
Finally, readers who are primarily interested in stress systems may ﬁnd
the typology itself to be an improvement on previous work. x1 reviewed several paradigmatic gaps involving foot form and iterativity, which Hayes (1985,
1995) discussed in his groundbreaking synthesis, and which have persisted as
gaps in recent OT accounts. The present work—constrained by the restricted OTP
framework—was forced to construct a different paradigm. The happy result, as
previewed in x1, is apparently to boil down all the apparent gaps to two uncontroversial stipulations: that syllable structure is asymmetric, and that extrametricality
is asymmetric.
