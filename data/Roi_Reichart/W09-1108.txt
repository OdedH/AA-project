Abstract
Sets of lexical items sharing a signiﬁcant
aspect of their meaning (concepts) are fundamental for linguistics and NLP. Unsupervised concept acquisition algorithms have
been shown to produce good results, and are
preferable over manual preparation of concept resources, which is labor intensive, error prone and somewhat arbitrary. Some existing concept mining methods utilize supervised language-speciﬁc modules such as POS
taggers and computationally intensive parsers.
In this paper we present an efﬁcient fully
unsupervised concept acquisition algorithm
that uses syntactic information obtained from
a fully unsupervised parser. Our algorithm
incorporates the bracketings induced by the
parser into the meta-patterns used by a symmetric patterns and graph-based concept discovery algorithm. We evaluate our algorithm
on very large corpora in English and Russian,
using both human judgments and WordNetbased evaluation. Using similar settings as
the leading fully unsupervised previous work,
we show a signiﬁcant improvement in concept quality and in the extraction of multiword
expressions. Our method is the ﬁrst to use
fully unsupervised parsing for unsupervised
concept discovery, and requires no languagespeciﬁc tools or pattern/word seeds.

Introduction

Comprehensive lexical resources for many domains
and languages are essential for most NLP applications. One of the most utilized types of such resources is a repository of concepts: sets of lexical
items sharing a signiﬁcant aspect of their meanings
(e.g., types of food, tool names, etc).

While handcrafted concept databases (e.g., WordNet) are extensively used in NLP, manual compilation of such databases is labor intensive, error prone,
and somewhat arbitrary. Hence, for many languages
and domains great efforts have been made for automated construction of such databases from available corpora. While language-speciﬁc and domainspeciﬁc studies show signiﬁcant success in development of concept discovery frameworks, the majority
of domains and languages remain untreated. Hence
there is a need for a framework that performs well
for many diverse settings and is as unsupervised and
language-independent as possible.
Numerous methods have been proposed for seedbased concept extraction where a set of concept patterns (or rules), or a small set of seed words for each
concept, is provided as input to the concept acquisition system. However, even simple deﬁnitions for
concepts are not always available.
To avoid requiring this type of input, a number of
distributional and pattern-based methods have been
proposed for fully unsupervised seed-less acquisition of concepts from text. Pattern-based algorithms
were shown to obtain high quality results while being highly efﬁcient in comparison to distributional
methods. Such fully unsupervised methods do not
incorporate any language-speciﬁc parsers or taggers,
so can be successfully applied to diverse languages.
However, unsupervised pattern-based methods
suffer from several weaknesses. Thus they are frequently restricted to single-word terms and are unable to discover multiword expressions in efﬁcient
and precise manner. They also usually ignore potentially useful part-of-speech and other syntactic information. In order to address these weaknesses,
several studies utilize language-speciﬁc parsing or

tagging systems in concept acquisition. Unfortunately, while improving results, this heavily affects
the language- and domain- independence of such
frameworks, and severely impacts efﬁciency since
even shallow parsing is computationally demanding.
In this paper we present a method to utilize the information induced by unsupervised parsers in an unsupervised pattern-based concept discovery framework. With the recent development of fast fully unsupervised parsers, it is now possible to add parserbased information to lexical patterns while keeping the language-independence of the whole framework and still avoiding heavy computational costs.
Speciﬁcally, we incorporate the bracketings induced
by the parser into the meta-patterns used by a symmetric patterns and graph-based unsupervised concept discovery algorithm.
We performed a thorough evaluation on two English corpora (the BNC and a 68GB web corpus)
and on a 33GB Russian corpus. Evaluations were
done using both human judgments and WordNet, in
similar settings as that of the leading unsupervised
previous work. Our results show that utilization of
unsupervised parser both improves the assignment
of single-word terms to concepts and allows highprecision discovery and assignment of of multiword
expressions to concepts.

Previous Work

Much work has been done on lexical acquisition of
all sorts and the acquisition of concepts in particular. Concept acquisition methods differ in the type of
corpus annotation and other human input used, and
in their basic algorithmic approach. Some methods
directly aim at concept acquisition, while the direct
goal in some is the construction of hyponym (‘is-a’)
hierarchies. A subtree in such a hierarchy can be
viewed as deﬁning a concept.
A major algorithmic approach is to represent
word contexts as vectors in some space and use distributional measures and clustering in that space.
Pereira (1993), Curran (2002) and Lin (1998) use
syntactic features in the vector deﬁnition. (Pantel
and Lin, 2002) improves on the latter by clustering
by committee. Caraballo (1999) uses conjunction
and appositive annotations in the vector representation. Several studies avoid requiring any syntactic
annotation. Some methods are based on decompo49

sition of a lexically-deﬁned matrix (by SVD, PCA
etc), e.g. (Sch¨ tze, 1998; Deerwester et al., 1990).
u
While great effort has been made for improving the computational complexity of distributional
methods (Gorman and Curran, 2006), they still remain highly computationally intensive in comparison to pattern approaches (see below), and most of
them do not scale well for very large datasets.
The second main approach is to use lexicosyntactic patterns. Patterns have been shown to produce more accurate results than feature vectors, at
a lower computational cost on large corpora (Pantel et al., 2004). Since (Hearst, 1992), who used a
manually prepared set of initial lexical patterns, numerous pattern-based methods have been proposed
for the discovery of concepts from seeds. Other
studies develop concept acquisition for on-demand
tasks where concepts are deﬁned by user-provided
seeds. Many of these studies utilize information obtained by language-speciﬁc parsing and named entity recognition tools (Dorow et al., 2005). Pantel et
al. (2004) reduce the depth of linguistic data used,
but their method requires POS tagging.
TextRunner (Banko et al., 2007) utilizes a set
of pattern-based seed-less strategies in order to extract relational tuples from text. However, this system contains many language-speciﬁc modules, including the utilization of a parser in one of the processing stages. Thus the majority of the existing
pattern-based concept acquisition systems rely on
pattern/word seeds or supervised language-speciﬁc
tools, some of which are very inefﬁcient.
Davidov and Rappoport (2006) developed a
framework which discovers concepts based on high
frequency words and symmetry-based pattern graph
properties. This framework allows a fully unsupervised seed-less discovery of concepts without relying on language-speciﬁc tools. However, it completely ignores potentially useful syntactic or morphological information.
For example, the pattern ‘X and his Y’ is useful
for acquiring the concept of family member types,
as in “his siblings and his parents’. Without syntactic information, it can capture noise, as in “... in
ireland) and his wife)” (parentheses denote syntactic constituent boundaries). As another example, the
useful symmetric pattern “either X or Y” can appear
in both good examples (“choose either Chihuahua

or Collie.”) and bad ones (“either Collie or Australian Bulldog”). In the latter case, the algorithm
both captures noise (“Australlian” is now considered as a candidate for the ‘dog type’ concept), and
misses the discovery of a valid multiword candidate
(“Australlian Bulldog”). While symmetry-based ﬁltering greatly reduces such noise, the basic problem
remains. As a result, incorporating at least some
parsing information in a language-independent and
efﬁcient manner could be beneﬁcial.
Unsupervised parsing has been explored for several decades (see (Clark, 2001; Klein, 2005) for recent reviews). Recently, unsupervised parsers have
for the ﬁrst time outperformed the right branching heuristic baseline for English. These include
CCM (Klein and Manning, 2002), the DMV and
DMV+CCM models (Klein and Manning, 2004),
(U)DOP based models (Bod, 2006a; Bod, 2006b;
Bod, 2007), an exemplar based approach (Dennis, 2005), guiding EM using contrastive estimation
(Smith and Eisner, 2006), and the incremental parser
of Seginer (2007) which we use here. These works
learn an unlabeled syntactic structure, dependency
or constituency. In this work we use constituency
trees as our syntactic representation.
Another important factor in concept acquisition
is the source of textual data used. To take advantage of the rapidly expanding web, many of the proposed frameworks utilize web queries rather than
local corpora (Etzioni et al., 2005; Davidov et al.,
2007; Pasca and Van Durme, 2008; Davidov and
Rappoport, 2009). While these methods have a deﬁnite practical advantage of dealing with the most recent and comprehensive data, web-based evaluation
has some methodological drawbacks such as limited
repeatability (Kilgarriff, 2007). In this study we apply our framework on ofﬂine corpora in settings similar to that of previous work, in order to be able to
make proper comparisons.

Efﬁcient Unsupervised Parsing

Our method utilizes the information induced by unsupervised parsers. Speciﬁcally, we make use of the
bracketings induced by Seginer’s parser1 (Seginer,
2007). This parser has advantages in three major as1

pects relevant to this paper.
First, it achieves state of the art unsupervised
parsing performance: its F-score2 is 75.9% for sentences of up to 10 words from the PennTreebank
Wall Street Journal corpus (WSJ) (Marcus, 1993),
and 59% for sentences of the same length from the
German NEGRA (Brants, 1997) corpus. These corpora consists of newspaper texts.
Second, to obtain good results, manually created
POS tags are used as input in all the unsupervised
parsers mentioned above except of Seginer’s, which
uses raw sentences as input. (Headden et al., 2008)
have shown that the performance of algorithms that
require POS tags substantially decreases when using
POS tags induced by unsupervised POS taggers instead of manually created ones. Seginer’s incremental parser is therefore the only fully unsupervised
parser providing high quality parses.
Third, Seginer’s parser is extremely fast. During
its initial stage, the parser builds a lexicon. Our Pentium 2.8GHB machines with 4GHB RAM can store
in memory the lexicon created by up to 0.2M sentences. We thus divided our corpora to batches of
0.2M sentences and parsed each of them separately.
Note that in this setup parsing quality might be even
better than the quality reported in (Seginer, 2007),
since in the setup reported in that paper the parser
was applied to a few thousand sentences only. On
average, the parsing time of a single batch was 5
minutes (run time did not signiﬁcantly differ across
batches and corpora).
Parser description. The parser utilizes the novel
common-cover link representation for syntactic
structure. This representation resembles dependency structure but unlike the latter, it can be translated into a constituency tree, which is the syntactic
representation we use in this work.
The parsing algorithm creates the common-cover
links structure of a sentence in an incremental manner. This means that the parser reads the words of
a sentence one after the other and, as each word is
read, it is only allowed to add links that have one of
their ends at that words (and update existing ones).
Words which have not yet been read are not availF = 2·R·P , where R and P are the recall and precision of
R+P
the parsers’ bracketing compared to manually created bracketing of the same text. This is the accepted measure for parsing
performance (see (Klein, 2005)).

able to the parser at this stage. This restriction is
inspired by psycholinguistics research which suggests that humans process language incrementally.
This results in a signiﬁcant restriction of the parser’s
search space, which is the reason it is so fast.
During its initial stage the parser builds a lexicon
containing, for each word, statistics helping the decision of whether to link that word to other words. The
lexicon is updated as any new sentence is read. Lexicon updating is also done in an incremental manner
so this stage is also very fast.

Unsupervised Pattern Discovery

In the ﬁrst stage of our algorithm, we run the unsupervised parser on the corpus in order to produce a
bracketing structure for each sentence. In the second stage, described here, we use these bracketings
in order to discover, in a fully unsupervised manner,
patterns that could be useful for concept mining.
Our algorithm is based on the concept acquisition
method of (Davidov and Rappoport, 2006). We discover patterns that connect terms belonging to the
same concept in two main stages: discovery of pattern candidates, and identiﬁcation of the symmetric
patterns among the candidates.
Pattern candidates. A major idea of (Davidov
and Rappoport, 2006) is that a few dozen high frequency words (HFW) such as ‘and’ and ‘is’ connect other, less frequent content terms into relationships. They deﬁne meta-patterns, which are short
sequences of H’s and C’s, where H is a slot for
a HFW and C is a slot for a content word (later
to become a word belonging to a discovered concept). Their method was shown to produce good
results. However, the fact that it does not consider
any syntactic information causes problems. Specifically, it does not consider the constituent structure
of the sentence. Meta-patterns that cross constituent
boundaries are likely to generate noise – two content
words (C’s) in a meta-pattern that belong to different constituents are likely to belong to different concepts as well. In addition, meta-patterns that do not
occupy a full constituent are likely to ‘cut’ multiword expressions (MWEs) into two parts, one part
that gets treated as a valid C word and one part that
is completely ignored.
The main idea in the present paper is to use the
51

bracketings induced by unsupervised parsers in order to avoid the problems above. We utilize bracketing boundaries in our meta-patterns in addition
to HFW and C slots. In other words, their original meta-patterns are totally lexical, while ours are
lexico-syntactic meta-patterns. We preserve the attractive properties of meta-patterns, because both
HFWs and bracketings can be found or computed in
a language independent manner and very efﬁciently.
Concretely, we deﬁne a HFW as a word appearing
more than TH times per million words, and a C as
a word or multiword expression containing up to 4
words, appearing less than TC times per million.
We require that our patterns include two slots for
C’s, separated by at least a single HFW or bracket.
We allow separation by a single bracket because the
lowest level in the induced bracketing structure usually corresponds to lexical items, while higher levels
correspond to actual syntactic constituents.
In order to avoid truncation of multiword expressions, we also require the meta pattern to start and
end by a HFW or bracket. Thus our meta-patterns
match the following regular expression:
{H|B}∗ C1 {H|B}+ C2 {H|B}∗
where “*” means zero or more times, and “+” means
one or more time and B can be “(”,“)” brackets produced by the parser (in these patterns we do not
need to guarantee that brackets match properly). Examples of such patterns include “((C1 )in C2 ))”,
“(C1 )(such(as(((C2 )”, and “(C1 )and(C2 )”3 . We
dismiss rare patterns that appear less than TP times
per million words.
Symmetric patterns. Many of the pattern candidates discovered in the previous stage are not usable.
In order to ﬁnd a usable subset, we focus on the symmetric patterns. We deﬁne a symmetric pattern as a
pattern in which the same pair of terms (C words)
is likely to appear in both left-to-right and right-toleft orders. In order to identify symmetric patterns,
for each pattern we deﬁne a pattern graph G(P ), as
proposed by (Widdows and Dorow, 2002). If term
pair (C1 , C2 ) appears in pattern P in some context,
3

This paper does not use any punctuation since the parser
is provided with sentences having all non-alphabetic characters
removed. We assume word separation. C1,2 can be a word or a
multiword expression.

we add nodes c1 , c2 to the graph and a directed edge
EP (c1 , c2 ) between them. In order to select symmetric patterns, we create such a pattern graph for
every discovered pattern, and create a symmetric
subgraph SymG(P) in which we take only bidirectional edges from G(P ). Then we compute three
measures for each pattern candidate as proposed by
(Davidov and Rappoport, 2006):
M1 (P ) :=

|{c1 |∃c2 EP (c1 , c2 ) ∧ ∃c3 EP (c3 , c1 )}|
|N odes(G(P ))|

M2 (P ) :=
M3 (P ) :=

|N odes(SymG(P ))|
|N odes(G(P ))|
|Edges(SymG(P ))|
|Edges(G(P ))|

For each measure, we prepare a sorted list of all candidate patterns. We remove patterns that are not in
the top ZT (we use 100, see Section 6) in any of the
three lists, and patterns that are in the bottom ZB in
at least one of the lists.

Concept Discovery

At the end of the previous stage we have a set of
symmetric patterns. We now use them in order to
discover concepts. The concept discovery algorithm
is essentially the same as used by (Davidov and Rappoport, 2006) and has some similarity with the one
used by (Widdows and Dorow, 2002). In this section
we outline the algorithm.
The clique-set method. The utilized approach to
concept discovery is based on connectivity structures in the all-pattern term relationship graph G,
resulting from merging all of the single-pattern
graphs for symmetric patterns selected in the previous stage. The main observation regarding G is that
highly interconnected words are good candidates to
form a concept. We ﬁnd all strong n-cliques (subgraphs containing n nodes that are all interconnected
in both directions). A clique Q deﬁnes a concept that
contains all of the nodes in Q plus all of the nodes
that are (1) at least unidirectionally connected to all
nodes in Q, and (2) bidirectionally connected to at
least one node in Q. Using this deﬁnition, we create
a concept for each such clique.
Note that a single term can be assigned to several
concepts. Thus a clique based on a connection of the
word ‘Sun’ to ‘Microsoft’ can lead to a concept of
52

computer companies, while the connection of ‘Sun’
to ‘Earth’ can lead to a concept of celestial bodies.
Reducing noise: merging and windowing. Since
any given term can participate in many cliques, the
algorithm creates overlapping categories, some of
which redundant. In addition, due to the nature of
language and the imperfection of the corpus some
noise is obviously to be expected. We enhance the
quality of the obtained concepts by merging them
and by windowing on the corpus. We merge two
concepts Q, R, iff there is more than a 50% overlap
between them: (|Q R| > |Q|/2) ∧ (|Q R| >
|R|/2). In order to increase concept quality and remove concepts that are too context-speciﬁc, we use
a simple corpus windowing technique. Instead of
running the algorithm of this section on the whole
corpus, we divide the corpus into windows of equal
size and perform the concept discovery algorithm of
this section (without pattern discovery) on each window independently. We now have a set of concepts
for each window. For the ﬁnal set, we select only
those concepts that appear in at least two of the windows. This technique reduces noise at the potential
cost of lowering coverage.
A decrease in the number of windows should produce more noisy results, while discovering more
concepts and terms. In the next section we show that
while windowing is clearly required for a large corpus, incorporation of parser data increases the quality of the extracted corpus to the point where windowing can be signiﬁcantly reduced.

Results

In order to estimate the quality of concepts and to
compare it to previous work, we have performed
both automatic and human evaluation. Our basic
comparison was to (Davidov and Rappoport, 2006)
(we have obtained their data and utilized their algorithm), where we can estimate if incorporation of
parser data can solve some fundamental weaknesses
of their framework. In the following description, we
call their algorithm P and our parser-based framework P+. We have also performed an indirect comparison to (Widdows and Dorow, 2002).
While there is a signiﬁcant number of other related studies4 on concept acquisition (see Section 2),
4

Most are supervised and/or use language-speciﬁc tools.

direct or even indirect comparison to these works is
problematic due to difference in corpora, problem
deﬁnitions and evaluation strategies. Below we describe the corpora and parameters used in our evaluation and then show and discuss WordNet-based and
Human evaluation settings and results.
Corpora. We performed in-depth evaluation in
two languages, English and Russian, using three
corpora, two for English and one for Russian.
The ﬁrst English corpus is the BNC, containing
about 100M words. The second English corpus,
DMOZ(Gabrilovich and Markovitch, 2005), is a
web corpus obtained by crawling URLs in the Open
Directory Project (dmoz.org), resulting in 68GB
containing about 8.2G words from 50M web pages.
The Russian corpus (Davidov and Rappoport, 2006)
was assembled from web-based Russian repositories, to yield 33GB and 4G words. All of these corpora were also used by (Davidov and Rappoport,
2006) and BNC was used in similar settings by
(Widdows and Dorow, 2002).
Algorithm
parameters. The
thresholds
TH , TC , TP , ZT , ZB , were determined mostly
by practical memory size considerations: we computed thresholds that would give us the maximal
number of terms, while enabling the pattern access
table to reside in main memory. The resulting
numbers are 100, 50, 20, 100, 100. Corpus window
size was determined by starting from a small
window size, extracting at random a single window,
running the algorithm, and iterating this process
with increased ×2 window sizes until reaching a
desired vocabulary concept participation percentage
(before windowing) (i.e., x% of the different words
in the corpus participate in terms assigned into
concepts. We used 5%.). We also ran the algorithm
without windowing in order to check how well the
provided parsing information can help reduce noise.
Among the patterns discovered are the ubiquitous
ones containing “and”,“or”, e.g. ‘((X) or (a Y))’,
and additional ones such as ‘from (X) to (Y)’.

covered by discovered concepts raises nearly 1.5fold when we utilize patterns based on parsing data
in comparison to pure HFW patterns used in previous work. We can also see nearly the same increase
in average concept size. At the same time we observe about 15% reduction in the total number of
discovered concepts.
There are two opposite factors in P+ which may
inﬂuence the number of concepts, their size and coverage in comparison to P. On one hand, utilization of
more restricted patterns that include parsing information leads to a reduced number of concept term
instances being discovered. Thus, the P+ pattern “(X
(or (a Y))” will recognize “(TV (or (a movie))” instance and will miss “(lunch) or (a snack))”, while
the P pattern “X or a Y” will capture both. This leads
to a decrease in the number of discovered concepts.
On the other hand, P+ patterns, unlike P ones, allow the extraction of multiword expressions5 , and
indeed more than third of the discovered terms using P+ were MWEs. Utilization of MWEs not only
allows to cover a greater amount of different words,
but also increases the number of discovered concepts
since new concepts can be found using cliques of
newly discovered MWEs. From the results, we can
see that for a given concept size and word coverage,
the ability to discover MWEs overcomes the disadvantage of ignoring potentially useful concepts.
Human judgment evaluation. Our human judgement evaluation closely followed the protocol (Davidov and Rappoport, 2006).
We used 4 subjects for evaluation of the English
5

While P method can potentially be used to extract MWEs,
preliminary experimentation shows that without signiﬁcant
modiﬁcation, quality of MWEs obtained by P is very low in
comparison to P+

concepts and 4 subjects for Russian ones. In order
to assess subjects’ reliability, we also included random concepts (see below). The goal of the experiment was to examine the differences between the
P+ and P concept acquisition frameworks. Subjects
were given 50 triplets of words and were asked to
rank them using the following scale: (1) the words
deﬁnitely share a signiﬁcant part of their meaning;
(2) the words have a shared meaning but only in
some context; (3) the words have a shared meaning only under a very unusual context/situation; (4)
the words do not share any meaning; (5) I am not
familiar enough with some/all of the words.
The 50 triplets were obtained as follows. We have
randomly selected 40 concept pairs (C+,C): C+ in
P+ and C in P using ﬁve following restrictions: (1)
concepts should contain at least 10 words; (2) for
a selected pair, C+ should share at least half of its
single-word terms with C, and C should share at
least half of its words with C+; (3) C+ should contain at least 3 MWEs; (4) C should contain at least 3
words not appearing in C+; (5) C+ should contain at
least 3 single-word terms not appearing in C.
These restrictions allow to select concept pairs
such that C+ is similar to C while they still carry
enough differences which can be examined. We selected the triplets as following: for pairs (C+, C) ten
triplets include terms appearing in both C+ and C
(Both column in Table 2), ten triplets include singleword terms appearing in C+ but not C (P+ single
column), ten triplets include single-word terms appearing in C but not C+ (P column), ten triplets include MWEs appearing in C+ (P+ mwe column) and
ten triplets include random terms obtained from P+
concepts (Rand column).

The ﬁrst part of Table 2 gives the average percentage of triplets that were given scores of 1 or 2
(that is, ‘signiﬁcant shared meaning’). The second
part gives the average score of a triplet (1 is best).
In these lines scores of 5 were not counted. Interevaluator Kappa between scores are 0.68/0.75/0.76
for DMOZ, BNC and Russian respectively. We can
see that terms selected by P and skipped by P+
receive low scores, at the same time even singleword terms selected by P+ and skipped by P show
very high scores. This shows that using parser data,
the proposed framework can successfully avoid selection of erroneous terms, while discovering highquality terms missed by P. We can also see that P+
performance on MWEs, while being slightly inferior to the one for single-word terms, still achieves
results comparable to those of single-word terms.
Thus our algorithm can greatly improve the results not only by discovering of MWEs but also by
improving the set of single word concept terms.
WordNet-based evaluation. The major guideline
in this part of the evaluation was to compare our results with previous work (Davidov and Rappoport,
2006; Widdows and Dorow, 2002) without the possible bias of human evaluation. We have followed
their methodology as best as we could, using the
same WordNet (WN) categories and the same corpora. This also allows indirect comparison to several
other studies, thus (Widdows and Dorow, 2002) reports results for an LSA-based clustering algorithm
that are vastly inferior to the pattern-based ones.
The evaluation method is as follows. We took
the exact 10 WN subsets referred to as ‘subjects’ in
(Widdows and Dorow, 2002), and removed all multiword items. We then selected at random 10 pairs of
words from each subject. For each pair, we found
the largest of our discovered concepts containing it.
The various morphological forms or clear typos of
the same word were treated as one in the evaluation.
We have improved the evaluation framework for
Russian by using the Russian WordNet (Gelfenbeynand et al., 2003) instead of back-translations as
done in (Davidov and Rappoport, 2006). Preliminary examination shows that this has no apparent
effect on the results.
For each found concept C containing N words,
we computed the following: (1) Precision: the num-

ber of words present in both C and WN divided by
N ; (2) Precision*: the number of correct words divided by N . Correct words are either words that
appear in the WN subtree, or words whose entry in

observe apparent rise in precision when comparing
P+ and P, but we can see signiﬁcant improvement
in both recall and precision* for all of three corpora. In combination with human judgement results,
this suggests that the P+ framework successfully discovers more correct terms not present in WN. This
causes precision to remain constant while precision*
improves signiﬁcantly. Rise in recall also shows that
the P+ framework can discover signiﬁcantly more
correct terms from the same data.
Windowing requirement. As discussed in Section 5, windowing is required for successful noise
reduction. However, due to the increase in pattern
quality with parser data, it is likely that less noise
will be captured by the discovered patterns. Hence,
windowing could be relaxed allowing to obtain more
data with sufﬁciently high precision.
In order to test this issue we applied our algorithms on the DMOZ corpus with 3 different windowing settings: (1) choosing window size as described above; (2) using ×4 larger window; (3)

avoiding windowing altogether. Each time we randomly sampled a set of 100 concepts and tagged (by
the authors) noisy ones. A concept is considered to
be noisy if it has at least 3 words unrelated to each
other. Table 4 shows results of this test.

We can see that while windowing is still essential
even with available parser data, using this data we
can signiﬁcantly reduce windowing requirements,
allowing us to discover more concepts from the
same data.
Timing requirements are modest, considering we
parsed such large amounts of data. BNC parsing took 45 minutes, and the total single-machine
processing time for the 68Gb DMOZ corpus was
4 days6 . In comparison, a state-of-art supervised
parser (Charniak and Johnson, 2005) would process
the same amount of data in 1.3 years7 .

Discussion

We have presented a framework which utilizes an
efﬁcient fully unsupervised parser for unsupervised
pattern-based discovery of concepts. We showed
that utilization of unsupervised parser in pattern acquisition not only allows successful extraction of
MWEs but also improves the quality of obtained
concepts, avoiding noise and adding new terms
missed by the parse-less approach. At the same time,
the framework remains fully unsupervised, allowing
its straightforward application to different languages
as supported by our bilingual evaluation.
This research presents one more step towards the
merging of fully unsupervised techniques for lexical acquisition, allowing to extract semantic data
without strong assumptions on domain or language.
While we have aimed for concept acquisition, the
proposed framework can be also useful for extraction of different types of lexical relationships, both
among concepts and between concept terms.

In fact, we used a PC cluster, and all 3 corpora were parsed
in 15 hours.
