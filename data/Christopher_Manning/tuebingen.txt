Dissociations between Argument Structure and
Grammatical Relations
Christopher Manning and Ivan Sag
Working draft of July 1995

Introduction

In what are colloquially known as HPSG1 and HPSG2 (Pollard and Sag 1987, Pollard and
Sag 1994:Ch. 1–8), the subcategorized arguments of a head are stored on a single ordered list,
the subcat list. However, Borsley (1989) argues that there are various deﬁciencies in this
approach, and suggests that the uniﬁed list should be split into separate lists for subjects,
complements, and speciﬁers. This proposal has been widely adopted in HPSG3 (Pollard
and Sag (1994:Ch. 9)) and other recent work in HPSG. Such a move provides in HPSG an
analog of the external/internal argument distinction generally adopted in GB, solves certain
technical problems such as allowing prepositions to take complements rather than things
identical in subcat list position to subjects, and allows recogniton of the special features of
subjects which have been noted in the LFG literature, where keyword grammatical relations
are employed (see Pollard and Sag (1994:Ch. 9) for more detailed justiﬁcation). In the
HPSG3 theory, it is these valence features subj, comps and spr whose values are ‘cancelled
oﬀ’ (in a Categorial Grammar-like manner) as a head projects a phrase. A lexical head
combines with its complements and subject or speciﬁer (if any) according to the lexically
inherited speciﬁcation, as shown in (1).1

This is a draft version of a paper presented at the T¨ bingen HPSG workshop, June 1995. We intend to
u
make considerable revisions to this paper. Towards that end, comments are welcome.

When Borsley (1989) suggested dividing the subcat list into multiple valence lists, we
believe that he intended that they would replace the subcat list. This is not in fact what
happened. In Pollard and Sag (1994:Ch. 9), the subcat list is kept as an attribute of
lexical signs. Its value is the append of the subj, spr and comps lists, in that order. As
presented there, this move seems more an expediency than a necessity: it allows the binding
theory developed in HPSG2 to be retained unchanged, rather than having to redeﬁne the
binding theory over the new valence lists. The subcat list might be thought of as merely
summarizing the valence of a lexical sign, without having any independent life of its own.
As conceived of by Pollard and Sag (1994:Ch. 9), it remains unaﬀected in the construction
of syntactic phrases, except that, in virtue of the various identities between subcat list
members and members of valence lists, the subcat list’s members become fully speciﬁed as
the valence list values are identiﬁed with actual subjects, complements and speciﬁers. Once
a complete phrase is constructed, the lexical head’s subcat list is fully speciﬁed and may
be used as the locus of binding theory. This is indicated in (2).

This redundancy has been broken in recent work. The canonical relationship between
the subcat list and the valence lists is still just an append relationship, but various other
possibilities have been explored. As a simple example, one way of handling valence reducing processes such as free pro-drop in Japanese is by allowing a non-canonical relationship
between the subcat list and the valence lists. For instance, in (3):
(3) Naoki-ga mi-ta
Naoki-nom see-past
‘Naoki saw (it).’
A lexical rule of pro-drop might have produced the lexical entry for the verb shown in (4):

The pro-dropped object NP does not appear on the comps list, as it is not realized on the
surface. But it still must appear on the subcat list so that we can explain properties such
as binding – for instance, here, we need to explain that (3) cannot mean ‘Naoki saw herself’.
3

With this new role for the subcat list – no longer used to capture surface syntactic
subcategorization, but as an attribute of only lexical signs, used to explain properties such
as binding and ‘deep’ subcategorization – the subcat list has become similar to certain
notions of argument structure. Thus, in recent work the subcat list has been renamed
as arg-s for argument structure, and we will use this name henceforth. But it should be
emphasized that the arg-s list is a syntactic representation, just like its predecessor the
subcat list, and is not to be viewed as a partial semantic representation or some sort of
substitute for one.
Pro-drop is a perhaps somewhat uninteresting example of a dissociation between the
valence lists and arg-s, but some of the work in HPSG since Pollard and Sag (1994) has
centered on analyses of data that involve more interesting dissociations between valency and
argument structure (Iida et al. 1994, Manning 1994, Sag and Fodor 1994, Sag and Godard
1994, Miller and Sag 1995). The existence of this new architecture takes HPSG a certain
distance from the monolevel, monostratal roots of GPSG and HPSG2. The purpose of this
paper is to better motivate the existence of two independent syntactic notions of valency
and argument structure and to examine the kinds of dissociations that can occur, with
special reference to causatives, binding and ergative languages. While doing that we will
articulate some proposed argument structure representations that diﬀer from those presented
previously, and for which there is interesting empirical support.

Binding Theory and Passives

The HPSG binding theory is based on hierarchical argument structure rather than constituent structure. As Pollard and Sag (1992, 1994) demonstrate, this approach to binding
provides an immediate solution to a variety of dilemmas facing any account of English binding stated in terms of constituency-based notions such as c-command. It maintains three
binding principles, analogous to those of Chomsky (1981); they are given informally in (5):2
(5) HPSG Binding Theory:
Principle A. A locally a-commanded anaphor must be locally a-bound.
Principle B. A personal pronoun must be locally a-free.
Principle C. A non-pronoun must be a-free.
The eﬀect of these principles is to require an anaphor to be coindexed with a less oblique
arg-s member, if there is such a less oblique coargument. Otherwise, anaphors are free
(subject to various discourse and processing considerations) to be bound by appropriate
elements in the discourse context.
This binding theory is adequate for English, but crosslinguistic coverage of binding phenomena requires more parametric options (Dalrymple 1993). We will introduce two other
possible conditions on anaphors here. In many languages, reﬂexives cannot be bound by
just any less oblique (local) NP, but rather their antecedence is restricted to what we might
2

A-command, a-bound, and a-free are to be understood as the same as the notions of o-command, obound, and o-free from Pollard and Sag (1994), now deﬁned on arg-s, but the new names are hopefully
more evocative of the argument structure based theory of binding we employ.

loosely call “subjects”. At least to a ﬁrst order approximation this is true of languages such
as Japanese, Russian, Inuit, and Sanskrit.3 Given that the binding theory in HPSG is deﬁned
on arg-s (an assumption that we will later actively argue for), the natural explanation for
such data is to suggest that in these languages, reﬂexives must be bound by the ﬁrst element
on some arg-s list. We will formalize such a notion with the deﬁnition and principle in (6)
drawn from Manning (1994).
(6) a. An a-subject is an entity that is ﬁrst on some arg-s list.
b. A-subject principle: Anaphors must be a-subject-bound (in some languages).
This allows us to explain why Taroo is not a possible binder in the Japanese example (7):
(7) Hanako-ga Taroo-ni zibun.zisin-no e-o
mise-ta.
Hanako-nom Taroo-dat self-gen
picture-acc show-past
(lit.) ‘Hanakoi showed Tarooj selfi/*j ’s picture.’
A second parametrization of the binding theory is that while classical reﬂexives are clause
bounded, many languages allow long distance reﬂexives. In particular, the pronoun zibun in
Japanese and both the lexical reﬂexive immi and the reﬂexive pronominal endings on verbs
in Inuit can be bound by any a-commanding a-subject. Such long distance anaphors might
be said to obey Principle Z (Xue et al. 1994).
Now consider the interaction of passive and subject-oriented reﬂexives. If our theory of
passive was that drawn from HPSG1 – a lexical rule that cyclically permuted the subcat,
now arg-s, list as in (8):

then our prediction is clear: the only possible binder of subject-oriented reﬂexives, the asubject, is now the NP that is the subject of the passive ( 2 ). However, in many languages,
this is not in fact the case. Perlmutter (1984) observed this for the case of Russian. While
in (9a), the reﬂexive sebe must be bound by the subject, in the passive (9b), the antecedent
can be either the surface subject or the agent argument (sometimes known as the logical
subject, following Jespersen (1924)).

`
b. Eta kniga

‘This book was bought by Borisi for himselfi .’
3

Although we acknowledge that there are complications in the Japanese data, and some or all of binding
in Japanese may be pragmatically determined, as emphasized by Iida (1992).

5

Perlmutter argued from these data that the passive must have a complex representation
of some sort (which was lacking within then current versions of the theory of passive of
‘surfacy’ frameworks like LFG). In particular, Perlmutter used these examples to argue
within Relational Grammar (RG) that both the logical subject and surface subject of a
passive must both be a 1 at some level: the logical subject is the initial 1, but on a later
stratum it is put en chˆmage and the surface subject becomes the ﬁnal 1.
o
In essence we accept this argument, and suggest that we want a representation for passives
(at least in languages like Russian) where both the surface subject and the logical subject
qualify as a-subjects. However, we would propose that such an analysis does not require
multiple strata of grammatical relations, as in RG, but can more restrictively be captured
by suggesting that the derivational morphology component builds signs with nested argument
structures.4 Indeed, below we will present arguments from ergative languages that such an
alternative analysis in terms of argument structure rather than grammatical relations is not
only possible but necessary.
The way to account for such data is to suggest that adding passive derivational morphology to a stem yields a form with a nested argument structure, and hence two a-subjects. We
will suppose that the universal characterization of passive is as in (10):5

In (11), the reﬂexive beneﬁciary 5 is on both the superordinate and subordinate arg-s lists.
This raises an important issue for the binding theory that does not arise in Pollard and Sag’s
(1992, 1994) account of binding in English, namely how to construe binding principles in
cases of argument sharing. Suppose we interpret ‘locally a-bound’ existentially as ‘locally
a-bound in some argument structure’. This means that if the beneﬁciary 5 is an anaphor,
4

For a similar argument, cf. Grimshaw (1990:167–173).
Note that this passive is intrinsically promotional; some have argued that the universal rule of passive
should only mention subject demotion, to account for certain passive-like structures where nothing is promoted such as in Lithuanian, but we would provide a diﬀerent (though related) derivational sort for such
cases.

then Principle A and the a-subject principle can be satisﬁed by 5 being coindexed with
either 1 or 2 , both of which are local a-commanders and a-subjects. This is exactly the
result we want to explain the Russian data above. Note that our theory predicts that the
surface subject is another possible binder of the anaphor in (9b), but this is being ruled out
due to its being an inanimate NP. Some further examples of passives from diverse languages
that support this analysis appear in (12):6

‘But a perjureri is to be ﬁned one eighth (lit. part) of selfi ’s property.’ (Sanskrit:
surface subject binder)
And, indeed, further evidence for this proposal can be found from the behavior of certain
adverbial clauses that are also sensitive to a-subjects. Thus, while the unexpressed subject
of a Japanese -nagara ‘while’ clause is generally described as necessarily being the ‘subject’
of the main clause as in (13):
(13) Yamada-san-wa hataraki-nagara daigaku-o
sotsugyoo si-masi-ta
Yamada-hon-top work-while
university-acc graduate do-pol-past
‘Mr. Yamada worked his way through college (lit. Mr. Yamada graduated while working).’
the controller of the subject of a -nagara clause can actually be another a-subject, such as
the logical subject of a passive, as is shown in (14):
(14) Hanako-ga Taroo-ni aruki-nagara aisatu s-are-ta
Hanako-nom Taroo-by walk-while greet do-pass-past
‘Hanakoi was greeted by Tarooj , while (shei /hej was) walking.’
Similarly, in Inuit, the a-subject of an inﬁnitival clause (whether expressed or not), must
be identical to the a-subject of a higher clause (Inuit allows long distance binding of these
inﬁnitival a-subjects in parallel with the behavior of reﬂexives). One possibility is coreference
with the logical subject of a passive. For instance, in (15), the a-subject of ‘prevent’ is
coreferent with the logical subject of ‘tie up’:
6

In the Inuit examples, the reﬂexive pronominal agreement marker is glossed as ‘4th person’, its traditional
name.

qilirsur-niqar-p-u-q
animalj kick.about-prevent-inf-3sg tie.up-pass-ind-itr-3sg
‘The animal was tied up (by somebodyi ), proi preventing it from kicking about.’
Thus the data from passives that we have examined argue for three things: (i) that there
must be a new more articulated argument structure for passives along the lines that we have
proposed; (ii) that passive must operate on argument structure and not the valence lists; and
(iii) that binding possibilities are sensitive to this argument structure, and not to surface
phrase structure or surface valence patterns.

Syntactically ergative and Western Austronesian languages

The HPSG architecture predicts that, in cases of dissociations between argument structure
and surface valency, binding possibilities and related phenomena should depend solely on
the argument structure conﬁgurations and be independent of valency. This prediction is
startlingly conﬁrmed by the behavior of syntactically ergative and Western Austronesian
languages. This is examined in more detail in Manning (1994), but will be illustrated brieﬂy
here, with an eye to the development of an HPSG analysis.
Western Austronesian languages appear to be unique in allowing various relationships
between argument structure and valence list conﬁguration, mediated by so-called voice
morphology. The best known case of this is perhaps Tagalog (Schachter 1976, Schachter
1977, Kroeger 1993), but here we will present some evidence from Toba Batak (Schachter
1984) and Balinese (Artawa and Blake nd). These languages have a more rigid conﬁgurational surface structure than Tagalog, and hence stress some of the points to be made more
clearly. In particular, they clearly show the independence of binding from surface structure
command relationships.
3.1

Toba Batak

Toba Batak has a distinction between active voice (mang-) and objective voice (di-) forms
of verbs:
(16) a. Mang-ida si Ria si Torus
av-see
pm Ria pm Torus
‘Torus sees/saw Ria.’
b. Di-ida si Torus si Ria
ov-see pm Torus pm Ria
‘Torus sees/saw Ria.’
The active voice (16a) has the logical subject of the clause appear in the ﬁnal subject
position while the objective voice (16b), which tends to be used in unmarked contexts, has
what we might term the Undergoer (Foley and Van Valin 1984), the proto-patient (Dowty
1991) or the logical object (Mohanan 1990) of the clause appear in the ﬁnal subject position.
Schachter (1984) provides evidence that both arguments in both voices in (16) are terms
(or core roles, as opposed to obliques and adjuncts); see also the similar and more extensive
8

arguments in Kroeger (1993) for Tagalog. Thus the correct analysis is not to view one of (16a)
or (16b) as a passive or antipassive (as has often been done in the generative literature), but
rather as exhibiting diﬀerent relationships between argument structure and surface valence.
In Toba Batak there is strong evidence that a verb and the following NP of a transitive
clause form a constituent, that we will call a VP, regardless of the verbal voice chosen.
Emmorey (1984) shows that the pitch accent of a sentence (denoted ‘∗’ below) occurs on
the last stressed syllable of the predicate, where the ﬁrst following NP of a transitive clause
counts as part of the predicate regardless of the verbal voice chosen:
∗
(17) a. [Muuli] angg´
´
ına
marry brother.his
‘His brother gets married.’
∗
b. [Mang-al´an ´ me] halak ´n tu malim ´n
e e
a
a
av-give
rice man
to priest
‘The man gives rice to the priest.’
∗
c. [Di-b´to m´lim] na man´ hor ´me pangula ´
o
a
u
e
ı
ov-know priest
buy
rice farmer
‘The priest knows that the farmer buys rice.’
An adverb cannot appear in the middle of the VP between the verb and the NP, though
adverbs can generally occur between other major constituents. VPs can be coordinated
regardless of the voice chosen:
(18) a. Man-uhor baoang jala mang-olompa mangga halak an
[av-buy onions] and [av-cook
mangoes] man
‘The man buys onions and cooks mangoes.’
b. Di-tuhor si Ore jala di-lompa si Ruli mangga
[ov-buy pm Ore] and [ov-buy pm Ruli] mangoes
‘Ore buys and Ruli cooks mangoes.’
Thus the ﬁrst NP of transitive clauses will be analyzed as being on the comps list and will
combine with the verb by Schema 2 as a head-complement phrase. Conversely, the ﬁnal NP
in the examples above will be analyzed as a VP-external subject which behaves similarly to
the ang-marked NP in Tagalog. Evidence for this is that this NP may optionally be fronted
before the verb in questions or as a topic, while the VP-internal NP may not be. Further, as
in Tagalog, relativization is restricted to this NP, and following the Keenan-Comrie (1977)
hierarchy, if only one NP can be relativized on, then that NP is the subject. Moreover it is
this VP-external subject NP that must be the controllee, regardless of the verbal voice:7
7

This data thus contrasts with the most common pattern of control in Tagalog where it is always the
agent/a-subject that is controlled (Schachter 1977). However, as Kroeger (1993) shows, cases of non-volitive
control in Tagalog do select the subject as the controllee, and cross-linguistically it seems that both of these
possibilities for identiﬁcation of the controllee occur. As observed in Manning (1994), the Tagalog volitive
control pattern poses a challenge for the locality principles standardly assumed in HPSG, but we will not
pause to consider this issue further here.

This suggests that the lexical entries for the verbs in (16a) and (16b) are (20a) and (20b)
respectively, and the analysis of (16b) is as in (21).

Di-ida
However, despite this clear evidence for phrase structure and grammatical relations, the
binding theory is insensitive to this structure. Reﬂexivization shows that an a-subject can
bind a non-a-subject (and not vice versa) regardless of the verbal voice of the sentence
(Sugamoto 1984):
(22) a. Mang-ida diri-na si John
av-saw self-his pm John
‘Johni saw himselfi .’
b. *Mang-ida si John diri-na
av-saw pm John self-his
*‘Himselfi saw Johni .’
(23) a. *Di-ida diri-na si John
ov-saw self-his pm John
*‘Himselfi saw Johni .’
b. Di-ida si John diri-na
ov-saw pm John self-his
‘Johni saw himselfi .’
To account for these reﬂexivization patterns using a surface structure based notion of command would mean suggesting that the phrase structure of the sentences in (22) and (23) were
radically diﬀerent, despite all the evidence we outlined above indicating that the phrase structure is the same despite the changing verbal voice. But these facts just fall out of the HPSG
11

theory of binding that we have been considering. For instance, although John does not
c-command the reﬂexive in (23b), it nevertheless a-commands the reﬂexive – the structure
of this example is identical to (21).
Schachter (1984) and Sugamoto (1984) suggest that binding possibilities are deﬁned by
the thematic hierarchy. However, whereas most thematic hierarchies place recipient above
theme (Kiparsky 1987, Bresnan and Kanerva 1989), they note that a patient argument can
bind an oblique recipient in Toba Batak. They take this as evidence that Toba Batak has
the language-particular thematic hierarchy shown in (24):
(24) Agent > Patient > Dative
However, this seems most unlikely. Many theories would rule out language-particular thematic hierarchies in principle, and at any rate, evidence from various other Austronesian languages suggests that in this language family, too, goals/recipients outrank themes.8 Rather,
we take this as strong evidence that binding is deﬁned not on the thematic hierarchy, but
rather on the independent syntactic level of argument structure. These facts follow a common pattern, namely that, at the level of a-structure, terms can bind obliques because they
are less oblique at a-structure, regardless of their semantic role.9 Thus these data provide
startling support for deﬁning binding theory on a level of argument structure that is distinct
from both surface phrase structure or valence lists, and distinct from notions like a thematic
hierarchy.10
3.2

Balinese

The evidence from Balinese is similar, and serves mainly to conﬁrm the patterns noted above.
Again there are two basic patterns for transitive verbs, as in (25). Balinese diﬀers from Toba
Batak in that the unmarked word order is for the subject to precede the VP, although the
subject may also appear postposed, giving the unmarked Toba Batak ordering.

‘I look for Putu at night.’
b. Tiang [ng-alih
Putu] metengang
1sg av.look.for Putu at.night
‘I look for Putu at night.’
Again, evidence for the indicated VP constituent comes from intonation, the positioning
of auxiliaries between the subject and the verb, and from the possible positions of adverbs.
The adverb in (25) can be moved to the positions of (26a) or (26b) but not (26c):
8

For instance Bell (1976:157) for Cebuano, Forsberg (1992:55f) for Tboli. Some other Austronesian
sources give thematic hierarchies like the one in the text for Toba Batak, but all cases we know of result
from what we regard as the same misinterpretation of evidence from binding.
9
One should be able to diﬀerentiate between these two hypotheses in Toba Batak by looking at binding
in the Dative Shift Construction (Schachter 1984:136) (which places recipients into a core role). But the
appropriate data are not available to us.
10
For general evidence against the use of thematic hierarchies, see also Davis (1995) and Davis and Koenig
(1995).

12

(26) a. Adv NP [Verb NP]
b. NP Adv [Verb NP]
c. *NP [Verb Adv NP]
Again both NPs above appear to be terms: neither can be deleted in either construction
and the undergoer-subject pattern is unmarked. Thus there do not appear to be operations
of passive or antipassive involved here. Further evidence for this comes from the fact that
Balinese does have a passive construction (perhaps borrowed from Javanese) which contrasts
with (25a) in that the agent is marked with a preposition, and is optional:
(27) padi-ne ka-ambil (teken Made)
rice-def pass-take (with Made)
‘The rice has been taken (by Made).’
Again there is clear evidence that the preverbal NP is the grammatical subject. The single
argument of intransitive verbs normally also appears before the verb. Only this argument
can be relativized as is shown in (28–29):
gugut cicing
(28) a. tiang ane
1sg rel subj ov.bite dog
‘I am the one the dog bites.’
b. *cicing ane tiang gugut
dog rel 1sg ov.bite complement
(29) a. cicing-e ane
ngugut tiang
dog-def rel subj av.bite 1sg
‘The dog is the one who bit me.’
b. *tiang ane cicing-e ngugut
1sg rel dog-def av.bite complement
And parallel to the data from Toba Batak, it is the subject which is the unexpressed argument
of controlled complements and purpose clauses, regardless of the verbal voice chosen (Artawa
and Blake nd:26).
Nevertheless, again we ﬁnd that it is argument structure prominence that determines
binding possibilities, so a grammatical subject can be bound by a complement, as shown in
(30):
(30) awak cai-ne
pedihang cai
self 2sg-poss ov.blame 2sg
‘You blamed yourself.’

3.3

Diﬀerent linking patterns through sortal cross-classiﬁcation

is handled not by a (destructive) lexical rule, but rather by a structure building operation.
There are still two possible analyses, depending on whether the structure building is handled
solely within the type system, or whether we have schemas that build up the structure of
morphological words. These two approaches seem equivalent for current purposes, but we
will use the former, Riehemann (1993) style, except when discussing the analysis of Iida et
al. (1994), which used the latter.
Within a theory of a hierarchical lexicon as presented in HPSG (Pollard and Sag 1987,
Riehemann 1993), we can seek to explain both the commonality of sorts like intransitive
verbs and transitive verbs across all languages and the systematic linking diﬀerences between
syntactically ergative and accusative languages through the use of multiple inheritance. That
is, in a syntactically accusative language, a transitive verb will say both that it is transitive,
and that it obeys an accusative linking pattern, and so on. A partial presentation of some
necessary sorts is presented in (31). Note in particular that sorts like intrans-stem and transstem only specify the arg-s list of their sort, and say nothing about the valence lists. The
‘mapping’ to valence lists (to use a procedural metaphor) is handled by separate language
particular sorts that cross-classify with the arity or polyadicity sorts (like intransitive and
transitive).11

In most languages, all verbs have a subject, and so the language would make all verbs subj-verb-stem,
but we allow for subjectless verbs in the initial verb type. The disjunction in (31f) appears necessary. In
syntactically ergative languages, with intransitive verbs, the ﬁrst argument on the arg-s list becomes the
subject, whereas with transitive verbs, it is the second argument on the arg-s list that becomes the subject.

14

Before, we suggested that a canonical stem is one where the valence lists ‘add up’ to the
arg-s. In (31e–f), we introduce a slight generalization of this notion, which has become
important in recent work on the treatment of causatives and light verbs, since we will need
this generalization in the next section. Under this new conception, a canonical stem is
basically as before, except that it might have extra things at the end of the comps list that
are not on the arg-s list. These things will arise via inheritance of complements from a
subpart of the current stem.
A verb in a particular language will then inherit its subcategorization sort, and a language
type particular linking sort. So, for an accusative language like English, a transitive verb
would have a type like (32a), for a syntactically ergative language like Dyirbal there would
be a transitive verb type like (32b), while a Western Austronesian language like Toba Batak
would allow both these constructions via a transitive verb type like (32c).
(32) a. eng-trans-stem → trans-stem ∧ acc-canon-stem
b. dyi-trans-stem → trans-stem ∧ erg-canon-stem
c. tob-trans-stem → trans-stem ∧ (acc-canon-stem ∨
erg-canon-stem)
The sort in (32c) (along with verb-particular information) will then license the two Toba
Batak signs that were shown in (20).
Thus this section shows that not all languages make exclusive use of a canonical relationship between valence lists and arg-s in basic lexical forms, if such is to be understood as
the arg-s list being the append of the subjs, spr, and comps list, in that order . Rather, in
Western Austronesian languages, another ordering is possible, indeed is unmarked (in terms
of both frequency of occurence and the verbal morphology). In this pattern, the arg-s of a
transitive verb is built by appending comps first , subj, and comps rest . For most
Western Austronesian languages, other mappings are also possible, such as where an instrument or location is promoted to the subject position, but we will not examine these patterns
here. In other languages, the syntactically ergative languages, the unmarked relationship in
Philippine languages is the only relationship possible for expressing transitive verbs (Dixon
1994, Manning 1994). These languages, which we will discuss a little more below, and the
Western Austronesian languages provide strong support for two independent syntactic levels, realized in HPSG3 by the valence lists and arg-s, and provide crucial evidence for the
argument structure based theory of binding that HPSG provides.

Causatives

There is now a large literature on causative morphology (e.g, Marantz (1984), Baker (1988))
and the related causative light verbs found in certain language families such as Romance
(Rizzi 1982, Aissen and Perlmutter 1983). The essence of the problem that these constructions pose is that on the surface various tests indicate that we are dealing with a single
clause, but various other syntactic tests have been used to argue that these structures are
really underlyingly biclausal.
15

Consider, as an example, causative morphology in Inuit.12 Causatives of an intransitive
and a transitive verb are shown in (33):
(33) a. Aani-p
miiqqa-t
qasu-nirar-p-a-i
Aani-erg children-pl.abs be.tired-say-ind-tr-3sg.3pl
‘Aani said that the children were tired.’
b. Hansi-p
miiqqat
uan-nut paari-tip-pai
Hansi-erg children.pl.abs me-term look.after-caus-ind.tr.3sg.3pl
‘Hansi had me look after the children.’
A sentence like (33b) behaves on the surface like a single clause. The causative verb form is a
surface word (Sadock 1980). The verb agrees with the lower object using the regular patterns
of object agreement (which would be quite mysterious if we were dealing with embedded
clauses).13 The case marking pattern allows only one each of the core cases ergative and
absolutive, as in a single clause. The unmarked word order is as shown: the causee follows
the lower object, as oblique NPs regularly follow core roles within a single clause, rather
than preceding it as if it were a subject. Additionally, there is evidence from (participial)
relatives: relativization is clausebound, but the lower object of these complex verb forms
can be relativized on (Johnson 1980:23). On the other hand, there is evidence that we might
be dealing with a biclausal structure. For instance, both the causer and the causee behave
as ‘subjects’ for the purposes of anteceding reﬂexives, and controlling inﬁnitival clauses.
For instance, (34) shows how the binding behavior of causatives (34a) diﬀers from that of
otherwise similar lexical roots (34b):
(34) a. Kaali-p
Pavia
immi-nit angi-nir-u-sinnaa-nngin-nirar-p-a-a
Kaali-erg Pavia.abs self-abl big-cmp-be-can-neg-say-ind-tr-3sg.3sg
‘Kaalii said that Paviaj couldn’t be taller than selfi/j .’
b. Juuna-p
Kaali
immi-nik uqaluttuup-p-a-a
Juuna-erg Kaali.abs self-instr tell-ind-tr-3sg.3sg
‘Juunai told Kaalij about selfi/*j .’
A common form of analysis postulates an underlying structure that is biclausal, and then
uses some mechanism of incorporation or restructuring to produce the monoclausal surface
forms. Such transformational analyses are unavailable within a lexicalist framework like
HPSG, but fortunately, more careful analysis suggests that such derivational analyses are not
required. The essence of the transformational analysis is that the causee of a causative (the
one who is caused to act) is a subject at some level. But here we will argue that although the
causee has the properties of an a-subject, it never has the properties of a subject in terms
12

In Inuit, “causative” morphology includes not only verbs of causing and allowing, but other verbs of
thinking and saying, which behave identically. Thus we will freely illustrate with verbs from a wider semantic
ﬁeld than pure causatives.
13
We use the following pretheoretical terminology for this discussion (from Marantz (1984)): the one who
is the agent of the causing event is the causer ; the one who is caused to act, and who is also the actor of
the stem is called the causee; and in cases of causativization applying to transitive stems, the direct object
of the stem to which causative is applied is termed the lower object .

16

of grammatical relations or valence list positions. This suggests that causatives can be
accounted for by a mismatch between valence and argument structure: these verbs will have
valence patterns much like any other predicate, but the causative verb will carry information
about multiple arg-s lists, so that both the causer and the causee will be a-subjects.
4.1

Japanese causatives

An analysis of this sort was presented within the framework of HPSG for Japanese causatives
by Iida et al. (1994). Here we will review the essence of this analysis. Centrally, the account
wanted to explain how causatives behave as a single clause on the surface, as is shown by
subject honoriﬁcation, word order, the Double-o constraint (Poser 1989) and nominalization,
while appearing in some sense biclausal with respect to phenomena such as adjunct scoping
and binding theory.
Iida et al. (1994) suggest that basic lexical entries of verbs can give rise to further forms
through the application of derivational morphology.14 Thus the Japanese causative yields a
new lexical form. Its relationship to the stem’s sign can be expressed as in (35).
(35) a. -(s)ase is suﬃxed in the phonology,
b. the stem’s content is embedded as the third argument of the derivational form’s
content, which is a ternary cause predicate,
c. the subj in the stem’s lexical entry is replaced with a new complement (marked
dative, or optionally accusative with intransitive stems), and a new subj, the causer,
is introduced.
This process will thus derive causative verbs with complex word structure, as illustrated in
(36) for the causative of the simple transitive verb tazune (‘visit’):
14

Iida et al. (1994) took no particular stand on whether this was by means of lexical rules as in Pollard and
Sag (1987) or through the sort system as in Riehemann (1993) or through schemas that build up complex
morphological forms, but they presented their analysis in terms of the last mechanism, and we will reproduce
it in that form here.

Note that here the ‘lower object’ NP (tagged 3 ) is present on both the lower and higher
comps lists. The subject of the lower list is however distinct from, but coindexed with,
the dative NP on the higher list. This coindexing has the eﬀect of identifying this element
on the upstairs arg-s list semantically with the subject argument of the lower verb stem.
Following this version of a causativization rule, the value of the arg-s list still bears the
append relation to the form’s subj and comps value, but below we will explore how causatives
in some languages diﬀer and appear to require the more general notion of canonical that we
introduced above.
4.1.1

Adverb scope

Let us now see how this analysis can be applied ﬁrst to adjunct scoping, and then to issues
in the binding theory. The central puzzle of adverbs within a lexical theory is to produce an
account of how adverbs can take scope over either the entire causative event or over just the
event described by the verb stem. In the analysis of Iida et al. (1994), the mechanism used
for adverb scoping provides an account of not only simple adverbs, but also of the behavior
of -nagara ‘while’ clauses, and -te phrases which they argue to be adverbial in nature (and
not to represent conjoined phrases). The analysis entails that adverbs may be added to
valence lists freely and hence, given suitable assumptions about scrambling, freely ordered
among the other complements (see Iida et al. (1994) for justiﬁcation).
The essence of the proposal is a lexical rule that adds an adjunct onto a verb’s comps list,
following Miller (1991) and other work. This rule is quite in the spirit of the Type-Raising
rule of categorial grammar.15 So consider the conjunctive adverbial in (37).
15

It’s a bit more complicated than standard type-raising, as it is done before other arguments are discharged, but all uses of the rule remain theorems of the Lambek calculus.

Note that the adverbial phrase in this example appears higher in the tree than the
causative verb, but nonetheless modiﬁes only the verbal stem kaw . Given that the modiﬁcation relations are ﬁxed by the lexical entries and the phrases they project, the same
interpretation results from a diﬀerent scrambled ordering such as (41):
19

(41) Ken wa Naomi ni atarasii kutu o

Ken top Naomi dat new

4.1.2

Reﬂexives

Perhaps the best candidate for a true anaphor in Japanese is the expression zibun-zisin
which appears to obey Principle A in multiclausal structures (Kitagawa 1986). Additionally,
recall that in Japanese only a-subjects are possible binders. Also, (42) shows that the basic
prediction of the HPSG binding theory, that anaphors with no local a-commander are exempt
from Principle A, is also conﬁrmed for Japanese.
(42) Zibun-zisini -ga hihan.s.are.ta koto-ga
Tarooi -o nayamaete-iru.
self-nom
was.criticized comp-nom Taroo-acc bother-prog
(lit.) ‘The fact that self was criticized bothers Taroo.’
We may now examine the predictions made by our lexical analysis of causatives. One
key aspect of the analysis is that all members of the comps list of the lower verb are also on
the causative verb’s comps list. Further, the arg-s list of the causative verb is the append
of that verb’s subj and comps values, as illustrated in (43).

In (43), the lower object 3 is on both the superordinate and subordinate arg-s lists.
Recall that in cases of argument sharing like this that the binding principles are construed
existentially. We interpret locally a-bound as ‘locally a-bound in some argument structure’.
This means that if the object 3 is in fact the anaphor zibun-zisin, then Principle A can be
satisﬁed by 3 being coindexed with either 1 or 4 , both of which are local a-commanders and
a-subjects. This is exactly the right result, as pointed out by Kitagawa (1986) who observes
the ambiguity of (44):
(44) Tarooi ga Zirooj ni aete
zibun-zisini/j o
hihans-ase-ta.
Taroo nom Ziroo dat purposefully self
acc criticize-caus-past
‘Taroo purposefully made Ziroo criticize himself.’ (Kitagawa 1986:(92))

20

4.1.3

Pronouns

Now let us consider the pronominal coreference facts shown in (45):
(45) Tarooi-wa Zirooj -ni ∅i/*j bengos-ase-ta.
Taroo-top Ziroo-dat
defend-caus-past
‘Tarooi made Zirooj defend himi/*j .’
The zero pronoun, or the alleged pronoun kare,16 in the lower object position allows the
surface subject, but not the lower subject (the causee), as its antecedent.
Again, the observed facts follow immediately from an existential interpretation of the
binding theory – pronouns must be locally a-free in some argument structure. Considering
again (43), we see that coindexation of the subject and the lower object is possible, because
there remains an arg-s list, the lower one, with an a-commander on which the lower object
is a-free. However, the lower object cannot be coindexed with the causee, because the
causee shares an index with the lower subject, hence indexing the lower object in this way
would leave no argument structure where that pronominal was locally a-free, in violation of
Principle B. Hence, simply by imposing an existential interpretation (one which alters none
of the binding theory’s predictions for English), Principle B rules out coreference between
the lower object and the causee, but nothing blocks coreference between the lower object
and the causer because the surface subject isn’t on the lower arg-s list.
4.2

Extending the account to quantiﬁer scope

There is a problem about quantiﬁer scope similar to that posed by the interaction of adverbs
and causatives. In certain languages, a quantiﬁed NP functioning as the lower object of a
lexical causative can take intermediate scope, i.e. can take scope over the verb stem, but be
outscoped by the causative operator. This is illustrated for the Japanese example in (46).
(46) Tanaka-sensei-ga gakusei-ni sansatu hon-o yomaseta
Prof. Tanaka-nom student-dat three book-acc read-caus-past
‘Prof. Tanaka made the student read three books.’
The semantic embedding (‘cause-to-read’) is presumably lexically encoded, i.e. given as part
of the lexical entry of the causative verb. Thus the problem posed by such examples is
basically the problem of how to assign ‘word-internal’ scope to a quantiﬁed NP that appears
external to the lexical causative. In order to deal with this matter, which Iida et al. did not
address, we must ﬁrst enter a slight digressions about the treatment of quantiﬁer scope in
HPSG.
The theory of quantiﬁer scope presented in Pollard and Sag (1994: Ch.8) is based on
the technique of quantiﬁer storage pioneered by Robin Cooper (see Cooper 1983). Cooper
storage is a method allowing a variable to go proxy for a quantiﬁer’s contribution to the
interpretation of a sentence, while the quantiﬁer which binds that variable is placed in a
‘store’. Stored quantiﬁers are gathered up from the daughters of a phrase and passed up
to successively higher levels of structure until an appropriate scope assignment locus, e.g. a
16

See Iida et al. (1994) for discussion of why kare probably should not be treated as a pronoun.

21

clause, is reached. Then quantiﬁer(s) may then be retrieved from storage and integrated into
the interpretation, receiving a wide scope interpretation. On Pollard and Sag’s version of
Cooper’s theory, all quantiﬁers ‘start out’ in storage, and retrieval is allowed freely at higher
levels of structure (subject to various constraints). This means that the scope assigned to a
quantiﬁer can in principle be any semantic domain that contains the content corresponding
to the clause the quantiﬁed NP occurs in.
The theory presented by Pollard and Sag has at least one serious defect (exactly the same
defect as Montague’s (1974) ‘proper’ treatment, incidentally), which is its failure to provide
for the possibility that in raising constructions, a quantiﬁer may have scope corresponding
to a lower syntactic position. As is well known, a sentence like (47), for example, allows a
‘de dicto’ reading where the matrix subject takes narrow scope with respect to seems:
(47) A unicorn seems to be approaching.
‘It seems that there is a unicorn approaching’
In recent work, however, Pollard and Yoo (this conference) suggest a solution to this
problem. First, they propose to make Q-STORE (QS) a feature of local objects, rather than
a feature of the highest level (the sign), as Pollard and Sag proposed. This revision has
the consequence that within raising and extraction constructions, the stored quantiﬁers are
identiﬁed. That is, the QS value of the subject of seems in a cascaded raising structure like
(47) is also the QS value of the (unexpressed) subject of to, the QS value of the subject of be,
and that of the subject of approaching. Thus if the NP a unicorn in (47) has an existential
quantiﬁer in its QS, so does the SUBJ value of the lowest verb in (47) – the one that assigns
a semantic role to the index bound by that quantiﬁer.
Pollard and Yoo propose to change the way storage works, so that unscoped quantiﬁers
are passed up to the mother in a headed structure not from all the daughters, but only from
the semantic head daughter. To achieve this, they let the QS value of a verb V be the set
union of the QS values of V’s ARG-S members (at least those ARG-S members that are
assigned a role in the CONTENT value of V). This is illustrated in (48).

Let us ignore adjuncts for present purposes; the syntactic head and semantic head will

reads

This account correctly allows both possible scopings for (51). It also assigns to (47) a reading
where the subject has narrow scope with respect to seems, because QS is now part of LOCAL
and hence the SUBJ value of seems is the SUBJ value of to and be and hence is the SUBJ
value (and ﬁrst ARG-S member) of approaching, which collects its own QSTORE value
from those of its arguments. Thus the QSTORE of approaching in (47) contains a-unicorn
and that quantiﬁer can hence be retrieved from storage anywhere in the tree higher than
approaching. This allows for the possibility of scoping a-unicorn inside the scope of seems.
A problem with this approach, however, is that it lets retrieval happen in too many
places. This system (like the one in P&S-94) produces spurious analyses of every available
reading. For example, allowing both S and VP retrieval in structures like (51) produces each
possible scoping in three diﬀerent ways (veriﬁcation of this left as an exercise for the reader).
This problem is not insurmountable, however. One way of eliminating this redundancy
is to let retrieval and scope assignment be entirely lexical in nature, eliminating the feature RETRIEVED. This proposal, similar in certain ways to lexical type raising, involves
modifying the lexical entry for reads along the lines sketched in (52).

Other aspects of the Pollard/Yoo theory remain unchanged. Thus, each lexical head
thus gets a chance to scope the quantiﬁers of its role-assigned arguments, and the quantiﬁers
from those arguments that are not scoped remain in the verb’s QSTORE to be passed up
to higher levels of structure. Since there is no structure-based retrieval, a sentence like (51)
has no spurious retrievals. The word reads simply allows the two readings (corresponding to
two distinct orderings of the quantiﬁers on the verb’s QUANTS list). And this modiﬁcation
of the Pollard/Yoo theory still produces the correct two readings for A unicorn seems to be
approaching (allowing seems or approaching to assign scope to a-unicorn.18
So now, returning to causatives. it would seem natural that a language whose stems are
salient enough to be involved in Binding Theory should also extend scope assignment to
stems. For example, the Japanese stem yom (‘read’) has the following lexical entry that is
in all relevant ways identical to that of the word reads given in (52):

But allowing this kind of semantic content for the stem means that the object of yom,
even when it is merged into the ARG-S list of the causative form yomaseta – where it will
correspond to an NP external to that word – can be assigned an intermediate scope, as in
(54):
18

We must of course ensure that semantically vacuous raising verbs like to and be do not assign scope
lexically. Once that is guaranteed, then we will have only one analysis for each scope, as desired.

In sum, the lexically based revision of the Pollard/Yoo theory of quantiﬁer storage and
quantiﬁer scoping seems to ﬁt well with the theory of Japanese causatives presented by Iida
et al. Although complex words of Japanese preserve their lexical integrity (Bresnan and
Mchombo 1995), NPs external to those words may still be assigned scope intermediate to
the semantic elements of the causative item. This result follows once verbal stems, rather
than words, are taken as the locus for quantiﬁer retrieval. We speculate that stem-based
scope assignment in the unmarked case will be correlated with stem-based binding of the
sort proposed by Iida et al, but that languages that base binding on words and scope on
stems (or vice versa) might well exist as a marked option.
4.3

Crosslinguistic variation in causatives

It is now well known that not all causative constructions behave identically (Marantz 1984,
Baker 1988). Morpholological and other monoclausal causatives vary with respect to binding
and passivization possibilities. Some of these possibilities are related to diﬀerences in the
treatment of the causee: whether it becomes the primary object, an indirect object, or some
form of oblique. However, this is not the only parameter of variation – for instance, the
causative case marking patterns are basically uniform across the western Romance languages,
but nevertheless they diﬀer with respect to passivization possibilities (Zubizarreta 1985). In
this section we will examine some of these parametric diﬀerences and how they might be
accounted for within an HPSG analysis. The basic proposal is that universally there are

26

a number of causative sorts, from which languages will choose one (or possibly more than
one).
4.3.1

Chi-Mwi:ni

Causative structures vary as to whether passivization of the causative can lead to the causee
becoming the subject, the lower object becoming the subject, or either. Given the lexical
entry for a passive morpheme proposed earlier, it is predicted that the diﬀerent passivization possibilities for causatives in diﬀerent languages should correlate with (i) the argument
structure ordering dictated by the causative morpheme in a certain language and (ii) whether
(independently) passivization is restricted to a single direct object, as implied by our passive stem sign, or can promote any object NP (this is the asymmetric object parameter of
Bresnan and Moshi (1990)).
Consider the case of Chi-Mwi:ni (Marantz 1984, Baker 1988). In Chi-Mwi:ni (and in
certain other Bantu languages, and in Chamorro), the causee always becomes the direct
object (55a), which we would represent by placing it ﬁrst on the comps list, and second on
the arg-s list of the causative verb, as in (55b).
(55) a. Mwa:limu wa-andik-ish-ize

Passivization of the Chi-Mwi:ni causative in (55a) can yield only one result: the causee,
not the lower object, becomes the subject. The contrast between (55a) and *(55b) illustrates this point, which is a direct consequence of what has been presented so far, given the
interaction of the stem, causative, and passive morphemes shown in (56c).

Evidence from binding theory suggests that the causative stem sort for Chi-Mwi:ni should
be slightly diﬀerent from the one we postulated for Japanese, and this new entry is already
incorporated into (56). In it, elements of the argument structure of the stem are not inherited
by the argument structure of the causative. Rather this is an example of the more general
notion of canonical , where complements are inherited from the stem to which causative is
applied, without their being added to the argument structure of the causative stem. This is
seen more clearly if we separate out the lexical entry for just the causative stem, as in (57):

This lexical entry underspeciﬁes the contents of the valence lists, so that we can combine
it with appropriate sorts for diﬀerent language types, which will yield varying mappings
between arg-s and the valence lists. If we combine this sort with the sort for acc-canonstem which we introduced earlier, this gives the following lexical entry for causative stems
in certain accusative languages:

Note that within this structure, the lower object (contained on the list L) only appears on
the embedded argument structure list. Given that Chi-Mwi:ni has a short distance reﬂexive
that obeys Principle A, this predicts that a reﬂexive lower object should be able to be bound
only by 6 (which is coindexed with the causee), and a reﬂexive causee should be able to be
bound only by the subject 1 . This is precisely what we ﬁnd:
(59) a. Mi m-ph ik-ish-iz-e
ru:hu-y-a cha:kuja
I sp-cook-caus-asp myself
food
‘I made myself cook food.’
b. Mi ni-m-big-ish-iz-e

himself
‘I made the child hit himself.’
c. *Mi ni-m-big-ish-iz-e
Ali ru:hu-y-´
a
I sp-op-hit-caus-asp Ali myself
Although the French causatives are periphrastic, Godard and Sag (1995) propose that the
argument structure relations in the sort caus-stem-1 are also the correct ones for the French
causative verb faire. In French, certain instances of reﬂexive cliticization are unexpectedly
ill-formed, as illustrated by the following contrasts:
(60) a. Jean lui est ﬁd`le.
e
‘Jean is faithful to him/her.’
b. *Jean s’est ﬁd`le.
e
‘Jean is faithful to himself.’
(61) a. Ili luij fait donner un livre aux enfants.
‘Hei makes the kids give himj a book.’
b. *Ili sei fait donner un livre aux enfants.
‘Hei makes the kids give himi a book.’
On Godard and Sag’s account, there is a general condition requiring that a reﬂexive clitic
can be realized (via the PR(onominal)AF(ﬁxe)S feature) on a given verb only if it corresponds
29

to a member of the argument structure of that verb. Hence the contrasts in (60) and (61)
are both explained by the assumption that in the lexical entries for the copula ˆtre and the
e
‘composition’ form of faire only elements of the verb’s COMPS list are shared with that of
the relevant complement (the AP complement of the copula; the V[inf]0 complement of the
causative). The shared complements may undergo cliticization onto the verb (resulting in
(60)a and (61)a) but reﬂexive cliticization would add a reﬂexive element to the verb’s prafs
value that is not a member of the verb’s arg-s, thus engendering a violation of the general
condition on reﬂexive clitics, and so is blocked.
The noncanonical subj/comps/arg-s allignments we exploit here for the treatment
of Chi-Mwi:ni lexical causatives are thus independently motivated for the analysis of periphrastic causatives in unrelated languages.19
4.3.2

Turkish and Inuit

In other languages, such as Inuit and Turkish, when a transitive stem is causativized, it is the
lower object that becomes the surface object, while the causee is expressed either as a dative
indirect object or as an oblique. Moreover, it is then this NP that is accessible to passivization. Given that we have argued that passivization is an operation on argument structure,
this suggests that the second argument of the causative predicate in these languages should
be coindexed with the lower object rather than the causee of the stem (when there is a lower
object). That is, the causative stem lexical entry will be as in (62a). For a transitive stem
in Turkish, this restriction will be combined with information from the sort acc-canon-stem
yielding the sort in (62b). With this sort, our prediction is that passivization would make
the lower object the subject in Turkish, which is exactly what we want, as is shown by the
data in (63).
19

Use of this noncanonical causative necessitates modiﬁcation of the passive sort we gave earlier, so that
it also will not lose additional complements that are not on the argument structure of the stem. A suitable
reformulation (already employed above) is:

Note that this sort continues to work for both syntactically ergative and syntactically accusative languages.
While binding evidence seems to necessitate the kind of non-canonical lexical entries that we have proposed
here, the result is clearly an undesirable complication of the passive lexical entry. We are still considering
other possible approaches here, such as the use of nested argument structures, as in Manning (1994).

An important prediction of all the causative lexical entries that we have examined is
that the causee is selected as the thing that is ﬁrst on the arg-s of the stem (i.e., the
a-subject of the stem), rather than as the thing that is the subj of the stem (in contrast
with much work in GB and other frameworks which regards the causee as the subject of
the lower clause). This prediction can be tested in a syntactically ergative language (or a
Western Austronesian one, if using the appropriate verbal voice). There, the two choices
make diﬀerent predictions: if our theory is correct, it is the a-subject of the stem that should
become the causee, whereas if the other theory were correct, it is the grammatical subject
which should become the causee.
An examination of the syntactically ergative language Inuit shows that the argument
structure based account of causative formation is correct.20 In a simple transitive clause
such as (64a), the ergative NP is the a-subject, but it is the absolutive NP that is on the
subject list, as shown in the verb lexical entry in (64b) (cf. the sort erg-canon-stem presented
earlier).

The question, then, is what happens when this verb stem is causativized. Is it the asubject or the subj that becomes the causee? The causative (65) conﬁrms our argument
structure based account of monoclausal causatives by showing that it is the a-subject that
becomes the causee.21 This shows clearly that the causee derives its special properties not
from being a subj (which it isn’t), but from being the a-subject of the stem.

We can test the correctness of this description by again considering passivization and binding.
Example (67a) shows that the lower object becomes the a-subject of the passive-stem (and
hence subject) upon passivization of a causative stem in Inuit. This is what we would expect,
since the sorts that we have already introduced yield the description (67b) for the verb in
(67a). Here, the lower object 2 k has become the a-subject of the passive stem’s arg-s, which
in turn becomes the subject since the passive stem is intransitive.

The Inuit terminalis case, in which the causee appears, can be thought of as being like a dative case.

Unlike some other languages, in Inuit, a stem can be passivized prior to the application
of causative morphology, as in (68a). This example also falls out from the sorts that we have
proposed, as is shown in (68b) (note that here causativization is applying to an intransitive
stem according to the left disjunct of (62a). We have only considered passivization here,
but this account can also be extended to antipassives in Inuit, along the lines sketched by
Manning (1994).

Inuit binding possibilities are complicated by the existence of coterm binding constraints
(see Bittner (1994), Sadock (1994), and Manning (1994) for discussion), and we will not
present a complete account here. But (69) illustrates the correctness of the most basic
prediction of our argument structure based binding theory. According to (62a), both the
causer and the causee qualify as a-subjects and we would expect them to be able to bind
suitable reﬂexives. Example (69) shows that this is indeed true, even for the oblique causee
that results when a transitive stem is causativized (69b).22

Conclusion

We began this paper by reviewing Borsley’s proposal to separate Pollard and Sag’s SUBCAT
list into SUBJ, SPR and COMPS lists and the decision by Pollard and Sag (1994: 375) to keep
the SUBCAT feature around, perhaps merely as a convenience, to treat binding phenomena
22

Examples of this latter sort are given by Fortescue (1984:144) and Bittner (1992:37) but it must be
pointed out that Sadock (1994) reports that his consultants failed to accept binding by the terminalis asubject (even though his own theory predicts it as well). This may just be because, out of context, the
ergative is a much more prominent possible binder. Everyone accepts cases like (69a).

34

in English. In the interim, we have examined (however superﬁcially) data from a wide range
of languages whose binding patterns are quite diﬀerent from those of English, or even from
each other. Above all, what we have tried to show is that one can use this subcat list,
better termed argument-structure, to considerable linguistic advantage.
We have argued that HPSG must draw a fundamental distinction between argument
structure and the valence features which Borsley proposed, which distinguish grammatical
relations. This in turn seems to alter the character of HPSG, by providing an important
second kind of organization on the dependents of lexical heads. In particular (following the
reasoning laid out in slightly diﬀerent terms in Manning 1994) we have argued that it is
possible to give a universal characterization of binding in terms of this notion of argument
structure – a characterization that in fact generalizes nicely over accusative and ergative
languages.
In the process of developing this account, we have been led to a number of more speciﬁc proposals about the nature of causatives, passives and the like. A perspicuous way
of formulating these proposals seems to be in terms of a small set of universally available
sorts and constraints associated with them (also universal, we might hope). Although the
ideas sketched here are preliminary, we hope that they can serve as a basis for subsequent
HPSG research that will try to distill generalizations from seemingly diverse cross-linguistic
patterns like these and to organize them into a tight system of universally available types
and simple constraints. The recognition of argument structure as an independent dimension
of grammatical organization seems to be an important ﬁrst step to take in the realization of
this goal.
