Presents embedded under pasts
Christopher Manning
April 9, 2005

In this paper I will discuss a rather recondite phenomenon in the area of sequence of tense
(SOT), exhibited by sentences like (1):
(1) John said that Mary is pregnant.
According to traditional grammar, this is a sentence where sequence of tense has failed to apply
(i.e., concord has been broken): standard sequence of tense rules would dictate use of a past tense
when embedding an event contemporaneous to the embedding verb under a past tense verb, giving
the sentence John said that Mary was pregnant. For some verbs breaking concord is impossible
(*Mary said that John builds a house) or can only have a present-as-future interpretation (John
said that the last spaceship to Mars leaves tomorrow ), but with stative verbs, as En¸ (1987) and
c
others have observed, this failure of sequence of tense to apply is associated with a rather special
meaning, which we will try to elucidate below. For the moment, let us merely observe that the use
of present tense seems to cause such sentences to end up saying something about a larger interval
including both the time of utterance and the time of the event described in the main clause. For
this reason En¸ calls them “double access sentences”, but that seems a rather dubious name as the
c
interpretation seems to rely on evaluation at a large interval, not just at two points.

Costa (1972)

Costa (1972) identiﬁed that one gets special readings when one has presents embedded under
pasts. However, some of the speciﬁc things she says seem to be wrong. At the highest level
she suggests (p. 45) that the crucial factor is “presupposed relevance”, whether “the speaker has
reason to consider the complement relevant to the conversation he is engaged in.” This may be
a reasonable ﬁrst stab, but some of the more speciﬁc remarks clearly reﬂect things that may be
1

common, but are not necessary conditions, as we will see below: “these come into play most clearly
if the complement describes a condition that is still true at the time of utterance” (p. 44), “often
enough because [the speaker] agrees with it” (p. 45), “it is not even necessary that the complement
describe an objectively true state of aﬀairs: what matters is the speaker’s presupposition of its
truth” (p. 45). Costa then tries to divide verbs into two classes, one of which allows and the other
of which disallows optional SOT (i.e., presents embedded under pasts). She suggests that “the
factive/non-factive dichotomy is really the fundamental criterion in distinguishing” (p. 46). I think
this is dubious. The notion of “present relevance” does seem of some use, and it is clear that
factives should thus usually be good because clauses embedded under them would tend to have
“present relevance” because they are true. 1 But presents under pasts are also good with verbs like
say and hear which clearly aren’t factive. Moreover, it seems to me that in appropriate contexts
of “present relevance” you can use presents under pasts for many of the verbs that Costa regarded
as B-verbs (disallowing optional application of the SOT rule):
(2) a. A detective says: “Bill knew that John knows the killer’s identity, so he did everything
possible to get him out of the country before we got to him.”
b. When I met Bill last week, he whispered to me that John knows the killer’s identity.
c. I found it hard to believe, but Bill insisted that John knows the killer’s identity.
d. Before he died, Bill alleged that John knows the killer’s identity.
However, it does seem that she was somewhat on the right track. It seems presents under pasts
are truly impossible only with what we might term anti-factive verbs: ones which imply that their
complement clause is false, such as imagined and wished.

Dowty (1982)

Dowty (1982) contains more than one proposal for dealing with tenses. In his ﬁrst proposal, one
would get for (1) the reading:
∃t[PAST(say-that (john, ˆ AT(t, PRES(pregnant(m)))))]
1

This is not to imply, of course, that everything that is true has present relevance.

2

Since the main clause verb introduces a new time index t, the main and embedded clauses will
be evaluated relative to separate reference times, and hence the tenses PRES and PAST in the
respective clauses gives the reading that John asserted at some time in the past that Mary would
be pregnant at the time of speech of the utterance. This is roughly what Hornstein (1991) believes is
the meaning of these sentences (see below). But Dowty rejects his ﬁrst proposal because it doesn’t
deal correctly with various other phenomena where the embedded clause’s event time doesn’t seem
to be independent of the main clause’s event time (a past under past that-complement sentence
like John said that Mary left is not possible whenever both the events are before the speech time;
rather the embedded clause event must precede the main clause event).
Dowty makes two suggestions for ﬁxing problems such as the interpretation of pasts under pasts
in that-complements, but unfortunately they both cause sentences such as (1), which Dowty was
actually not considering, to have no interpretation at all. For example under “Solution B” (p. 48),
the reference time of the subordinate clause is required to be identical to the speech time and to
precede or be identical to the past reference time of the main clause. The translation of (1) is
modiﬁed to:
∃t[t ≤ t∗ ∧ PAST(say-that (john, ˆ AT(t, PRES(pregnant(m)))))]
Since the introduced t is now constrained to be before t ∗ which evaluates as the ‘reference time’ i,
the two tense speciﬁcations now produce a contradiction (PAST says i < j while PRES says t = j
which is impossible given that t ≤ i). Actually, this is essentially also the result that En¸’s (1987)
c
basic system gives, but she adds special clauses so that some reading is generated, as we will see
in the next section.
3

En¸ (1987)
c

En¸ develops an alternative ‘GB-style’ theory of sequence of tense. I do not wish to expound it
c
in detail, but the upshot is that the initial version (up to p. 647) would yield exactly the same
result as Dowty’s later attempts – sentence (1) would cause a contradiction. En¸ thus suggests
c
the modiﬁcation that at LF, the indices of present tense and its COMP are changed to 0, where
0 denotes the speech time. This would yield the same reading for these systems as Dowty’s initial
proposal, and is thus a somewhat brute force way of resolving the tension between the facts that
when a past is embedded under a past, the two are related whereas when a present is embedded
under a past, the present still seems to “access” the current speech time.

3

However, En¸ claims that sentence (3):
c
(3) John heard that Mary is pregnant
has a more special reading than this: “the time of Mary’s pregnancy must include the speech time.
Furthermore, it must also include the time at which the matrix is evaluated, that is, the time
when John heard about it” (pp. 636–7). To capture this (putative) reading En¸ introduces a more
c
complicated system of double indexing, with only the ﬁrst index being rewritten at LF. Providing
that the complement moves out of the scope of the matrix past tense at LF, this would allow a
reading which requires the sentence to be true at an ‘extended now’ that includes the speech time
and the time of the event in the main clause. Alessandro Zucchi (p.c.) points out various problems
with this analysis – there seems to be no way of extending it to deal with future sentences and
the alleged evidence for the LF movement seems to be contradicted by the existence of sentences
like Every woman in this hospital learnt that she is pregnant by taking a test – but at any rate
we see that the analysis predicts that a sentence like (3) “is true if and only if the time of Mary’s
pregnancy includes both the moment of utterance and the past time when John heard about it”
(p. 653), presumably under the assumption that the reporting was veridical.
4

Hornstein (1991)

The account of Hornstein (1991) simpliﬁes the problem by claiming that sentences like (3) needn’t
have the complicated reading that En¸ tried to capture. Hornstein’s theory predicts that the time
c
of Mary’s being pregnant is the speech time. Period. Hornstein disputes En¸’s claim that a sentence
c
like (2) must be true at some form of ‘extended now’ that includes the time of the matrix clause
event. He points out sentences like (4):
(4) I heard from a reliable source that John knows the killer’s identity
According to Hornstein, (4) may be true if at some time in the past, I learnt from a reliable source
that John would know the killer’s identity later on, and that time has now come. The usual
implicature that the embedded state of aﬀairs was also true at the time of the matrix clause event
is attributed to pragmatic factors.
I think we have to concede that this reading of Hornstein’s is possible. Here is another example
that seems fairly plausible:

4

(5) Mary is talking to Bruce on Dec 3. She tells him that Claire is going to be in Boston on
Dec 4, Denver on Dec 5 and then in Washington from Dec 6–10. It is now Dec 8 and Bruce
is talking to Fred and he says, “I heard from Mary that Claire is in Washington now.” Or
alternatively, he could say, “Mary claimed that Claire is in Washington now”.
It’s not necessarily the preferred way of saying such things; often using was going to be or would
be in the complement clause sounds better, but I and the speakers that I have consulted seem to
agree that such readings are possible. It seems that such sentences are better with heard than with
just about any other verb and I think there is a good reason for this. If the verb is a speech act
verb, such as said it inevitably focusses attention on the matrix clause event, and it can thus be
very hard to get a reading in which the state of aﬀairs of the subordinate clause did not obtain at
the time of the matrix clause event. But with heard it seems considerably easier to keep the focus
on the information that was gained and how it relates to the state of aﬀairs at the time of speech.
There is thus a tension between the accounts of En¸ and Hornstein as to what the facts are,
c
but we will leave the resolution of this problem until after looking at the most detailed study of
the use of presents under pasts, that of Ogihara (1989).
5

Ogihara (1989)

In Chapter 4 of his dissertation, Ogihara considers a variety of hypotheses about the semantics
of present under past that-complement sentences. One limitation of his account is that he only
considers speech act verbs, although we have already seen that this construction occurs with mental
verbs like know or discover and with sensory verbs like hear and I think using other senses, verbs
like notice are also possible:
(6) John noticed that you are not behaving like your usual self.
Indeed, more precisely, Ogihara restricts himself to ‘positive’ speech act verbs such as say and
claim; ignoring ‘negative’ ones like doubt and deny and apparently ones that are sort of ambivalent
like conjecture:
(7) John conjectured that the Earth revolves around Pluto.
Nevertheless, he usefully works through a variety of conditions that needn’t hold for such present
under past sentences to be good. The following example (p. 300) indicates: (i) the state of aﬀairs
described by the embedded verb need not obtain at the time of speech; (ii) the state of aﬀairs
5

described by the embedded verb need not obtain at the time of the event of the matrix sentence;
(iii) the speaker need not believe the state of aﬀairs described by the embedded verb obtains at
the time of speech; and (iv) the subject of the matrix sentence need not believe that the state of
aﬀairs described by the embedded verb obtains at the time of speech:
(8) John and Bill are peeping into a room. Sue is in the room.
John (nearsighted): Look! Mary is in the room.
Bill: What are you talking about? That’s Sue, not Mary. Mary is not that tall.
John: Yeah, you’re right. That’s Sue.
1 minute later Kent joins them. Sue is still in the room.
Bill (to Kent): John said that Mary is in the room.
However, it is not the case that the acceptability of a present under past sentence bears no relation
to what is happening in the real world at the time of speech, as the abnormality of the ﬁnal sentence
in this example shows (p. 295):
(9) John and Bill are peeping into a room. Sue is in the room.
John (nearsighted): Look! Mary is in the room.
Bill: What are you talking about? That’s Sue, not Mary.
John: I’m sure that’s Mary.
Sue leaves the room; 1 minute later Kent joins them.
Bill (to Kent): *John said that Mary is in the room.
Indeed, note especially that this example would be bad even if the real Mary had walked into the
room at the same time as Sue left. The present under past reading only seems to be good if the
stimulus responsible for the embedded state of aﬀairs description continues to exist in the real world
until the time of speech. And yet, we seem to want an analysis where the truth of (10a) need not
imply (10b):
(10) a. John said two weeks ago that Mary is pregnant.
b. John said two weeks ago that Mary was pregnant and that she would continue to be
pregnant for at least two more weeks.
Ogihara suggests that if the main clause verb is factive then the truth conditions are as follows
for sentence (11):
6

(11) John found out two weeks ago that Bill is living with Sue.
“(37) [our (11)] is true iﬀ (i) John ﬁnds out at some past time that Bill is living with Sue at that
time and (ii) this state happens to continue until the speech time of (37)” (p. 302). But in line
with Hornstein’s examples it seems that this point of view is not always correct. It would seem
that this sentence could be used where someone described to John a state of aﬀairs that was soon
to eventuate. Such a reading seems easiest to get when a now is inserted into the embedded clause:
(12) On Dec 1, Bill is talking with John. Bill tells John that he and Sue are moving into a
1 bedroom apartment on Dec 10, which is when the redecoraters will ﬁnish their work. It
is now Dec 15 and John’s wife Mary is gossiping with Peter and says: “John found out two
weeks ago that Bill is now living with Sue.”
But let us put these examples aside and see what Ogihara proposes for examples like En¸’s.
c
Ogihara entertains the following hypothesis for present under past that-complements (p. 300):
(13) Hypothesis 4: If the individual denoted by the subject NP of the matrix sentence were
in the location of the original utterance now with all his physical and mental properties at
the time of the original statement intact, he would self-ascribe the same property that he
self-ascribed by uttering the original statement.
With the minor generalization of changing uttering in the last sentence so that the hypothesis
worked for other mental acts, this hypothesis seems fairly satisfactory. It would even seem to allow
some possibility of incorporating Hornstein’s examples, although I think that ultimately this would
be unsuccessful as the type of example that Ogihara is considering must be true of an entire interval
and not just of the endpoint of it. One problem with the hypothesis is that it does not allow the
viewpoint of the utterer of the entire sentence to inﬂuence acceptability, but this is a problem
that most other proposals also share. At any rate, Ogihara quickly rejects this proposal (p. 301):
“Hypothesis 4 seems to be inadequate because it is unfalsiﬁable” (although it is not very clear to
me why it is worse than other proposals in this respect).
Then his ﬁnal hypothesis is then the following (p. 313):
(14) Hypothesis 5: A sentence of the form [ s NP Past V1 . . . [s . . . Pres V2 . . . ] ] is true iﬀ
[s NP Past V1 . . . [s . . . Past V2 . . . ]] (with a simultaneous reading) is true and, moreover,
if the state claimed to obtain by the individual denoted by the NP did in fact obtain, the
state would obtain at an interval including the time of the matrix verb and the speech time.
7

Ogihara has attempted to move the discussion from the matrix NP’s (logical subject’s) attitude to
the state of aﬀairs responsible for it, so that he can regard present under past sentences as de re
attitude reports. This move might be plausible for the verbs he considers (like say and claim) but
does not seem tenable for attitude reports in general (with verbs like believe). This hypothesis also
involves a counterfactual, and hence is only as sound as our underlying theory of counterfactuals.
Unfortunately at about this point I move way out of my depth, but I will proceed with a few
remarks. Ogihara adopts the analysis of counterfactuals from Lewis’ Counterfactuals. (Now once
upon a time I read Barwise’s “Conditionals and Conditional Information” which set out to show
the irremediable problems with a possible worlds-based analysis of counterfactuals, but I will forgo
the opportunity to develop these issues here.) At any rate, returning to example (8), it is clear that
the notion of “world which is closest to the real one among the worlds which satisfy the condition
given in the antecedent of the conditional” would have to be not the one where Mary was in the
room as well as Sue, but the one in which Mary was taking the place of Sue, and apparently acts
as Sue does in the real world (and not as Mary might). In particular, Mary must stay in this room
in the possible world until the speech time, just as Sue did in the real world. It is unclear whether
in general there is a suitable means of ﬁnding such a closest possible world. One could suggest that
the correct interpretation of (8) is an issue concerning the treatment of names rather than tenses.
One way to explain what is going on might be that John is using a certain name for a certain
person and thereafter it can continue to be used as a situationally-deﬁned designator for another
person.
Another problem with choosing the right possible world to evaluate counterfactuals, suggested
to me by Alessandro Zucchi, is the following. Suppose that in the real world that Mary has reached
puberty only two weeks before, but that John has very wrong beliefs and talks about them. We
might then have the sentence:
(15) John said that Mary is preganant. He said that she is having a baby next week.
Now if we move to the nearest possible world that would make Mary pregnant, then presumably we
have to choose one where she became pregnant in the last two weeks (or else we would be changing
more than is necessary). But then the implications of the ﬁrst sentence clearly contradict John’s
other beliefs that Mary will be having a baby next week.
Finally, this account says nothing about the attitudes of the utterer of the whole sentence. Costa
suggested that the utterer was making an act of interpretation when choosing a present under a

8

past. Discussing the examples:
(16) a. Nixon didn’t say that the war in Vietnam was being technologized. He merely said it was
being Vietnamized.
b. Nixon didn’t say that the war in Vietnam is being technologized. He merely said it is
being Vietnamized.
she says:
To me, on the most immediate reading of [(16a)] Nixon uses the term “Vietnamization”
as a paraphrase of “technologizing”: in other words the complement of say reports a
certain claim of Nixon’s which the speaker presents as neither true nor false. But [(16b)],
with its present-tense complement, is on the best reading quite diﬀerent: the speaker,
not Nixon, presents what he sees as two facts, technologizing and Vietnamization, the
ﬁrst of which Nixon neglected to mention.”
I will return to this interpretative component at the end.

Abusch (1988)

Abusch (1988) also appears to have some trouble connecting the state of aﬀairs asserted of some
possible worlds by the embedded clause verb with the conditions that seem to have to obtain in the
real world for a present under past sentence to be good. But she concludes that this is a matter
of pragmatics (p. 8): “Under what circumstances the mismatch [between the embedded state of
aﬀairs and the real world at the speech time] is allowed seems to be a matter of pragmatics.” While
moving a problem into pragmatics is not of itself a solution to it, we have to ask ourself whether
Ogihara is wrongly complicating his account with facts that should be explained by a diﬀerent
component. I think he is, as I will attempt to explain at the end. But for the moment, let us
consider Abusch’s main example:
(17) John believed that Mary is pregnant but actually she has just been overeating.
The interesting thing about this example is that it seems that whatever circumstances caused John
to think that Mary was pregnant (presumably a distended belly) must continue to exist until the
speech time (in the real world) for this sentence to be good. It is not suﬃcient just that this state
exist in some other possible world. In both this example and the earlier (8), it seems that we have
9

a process of analogy at work where analogous conditions exist from the past through the present
and the speaker feels free to extend the validity of the matrix subject’s views to this later time
period. This would make interpretation very context dependent, but I think this is unavoidable.
7

Some ﬁnal thoughts

So, I think that we have to conclude that there is fundamentally a disjunction in the use of present
under past that-complements. One possibility is that the the matrix subject described/heard/
imagined etc. some future state of aﬀairs and that future time has now arrived. This is the usage
that Hornstein brought up as his counterexample. I ﬁnd this usage sort of marginal, but possible.
An informal sampling of Americans seemed to suggest that they were happier with this construction
than I. But even they tended to think that would be or was going to be would generally sound more
natural than is.2 This usage of the present is analogous to the use of adverbials that refer to the
speech time even when embedded in a that-complement, although use of the latter is more common
and does not imply use of this tense shifting. I think the reason that this usage is rather restricted
is related to the restricted distribution of presents-as-futures – both types of sentences are only
good when the state of aﬀairs described is regarded as an established certain fact. Thus, while
Hornstein’s example sounds quite good due to the use of context and the phrase from a reliable
source, the following sounds quite impossible:
(18) *I heard last night that it is raining today
The other usage, which the majority of authors discussed is when someone describes/hears/
imagines etc. something about the then current time but the speaker (rather than using standard
indirect speech) continues to use the present to describe the embedded state of aﬀairs when reporting
this event. As such, this usage crucially involves an act of interpretation by the speaker (as Abusch
observes) and can’t really be regarded as a veridical report of the matrix NP’s views. But this is
true in general of indirect speech. Another example of this due to Mats Rooth from Ogihara (1989,
p. 316) is the following:
(19) a. John (to Bill): “It’s beautiful”
2

A colleague suggested to me that in this usage is is “really just lazy for would be” – unintentionally revealing
the fact that she has never taken Linguistics 1. But of course this is not true, because this use of is is much more
restricted than the use of would be – it can only describe states predicted to obtain at the speech time, rather than
any time after the time of the main clause event.)

10

b. Bill (later): “John said that the Paciﬁc Ocean is beautiful.”
Clearly John’s remark was deictic referring to a particular scene – perhaps the view from his hotel
window on Oahu – but Bill is interpreting it as a view that he holds of the Paciﬁc Ocean as a whole.
And this is where Ogihara confuses semantics and pragmatics. Since the utterer of the whole
sentence can be interpreting any remark of the matrix NP, he can be interpreting a remark such
as one of the examples that Kripke discusses in “Speaker’s Reference and Semantic Reference”.
Indeed Ogihara’s examples with people peeking into a room are rather reminiscent of Donnellan’s
example:
(20) Smith’s murderer is insane.
only embedded in one more level of speech-act verbs. Donnellan regarded this example as showing
a referential/attributive ambiguity (contrasting the case of there being an unknown murderer but
the gruesome evidence showing that he was insane with the case of there being someone on trial
who looks insane and who the speaker is refering to as Smith’s murderer, though in reality this
person may or may not be guilty) but I would tend to follow Kripke and regard it as showing that
the name is allowed to have both a semantic referent and a (pragmantically determined) speaker’s
referent. When embedded under another speech act verb, the utterer is allowed to use the present
when the sentence remains true of the matrix NP’s speaker’s referent even if (as Ogihara shows)
either or both of these people now know that the speaker’s referent was not the semantic referent. If
we accept Kripke’s analysis of the “ambiguity” of a sentence such as (20), then clearly in embedded
contexts as well, the determination of speaker’s reference should pan out pragmatically. At any
rate, no matter what one thinks about pragmatics, this problem seems to be a separate one that
occurs in simple sentences as well, and hence shouldn’t be confused with an analysis of sequence of
tense. Thus while we are unfortunately proposing a disjunctive analysis of the whole phenomenon,
the analysis of this latter type of example should be simpliﬁed from what Ogihara or En¸ proposes.
