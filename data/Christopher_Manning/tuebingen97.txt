Dissociations Between Argument
Structure And Grammatical
Relations
Christopher D. Manning and Ivan A. Sag

In Pollard and Sag (1987) and Pollard and Sag (1994:Ch. 1–8), the subcategorized arguments of a head are stored on a single ordered list, the
subcat list. However, Borsley (1989) argues that there are various deﬁciencies in this approach, and suggests that the uniﬁed list should be split
into separate lists for subjects, complements, and speciﬁers. This proposal has been widely adopted in what is colloquially known as HPSG3
(Pollard and Sag (1994:Ch. 9) and other recent work in HPSG). Such
a move provides in HPSG an analog of the external/internal argument
distinction generally adopted in GB, solves certain technical problems
such as allowing prepositions to take complements rather than things
identical in subcat list position to subjects, and allows recognition of
the special features of subjects which have been noted in the LFG literature, where keyword grammatical relations are used. In HPSG3, it is
these valence features subj, comps and spr whose values are ‘cancelled
oﬀ’ (in a Categorial Grammar-like manner) as a head projects a phrase.
A lexical head combines with its complements and subject or speciﬁer
(if any) according to the lexically inherited speciﬁcation, as in (1).1

causatives are no longer discussed here and the reader interested in this topic should

When Borsley (1989) suggested dividing the subcat list into multiple
valence lists, we believe that he intended that they would replace the
subcat list, but this is not in fact what happened. In Pollard and Sag
(1994:Ch. 9), the subcat list is kept as an attribute of lexical signs. Its
value is the append of the subj, spr and comps lists. As presented there,
this move seems more an expediency than a necessity: it allows the HPSG
binding theory to be retained unchanged, rather than having to redeﬁne
it over the new valence lists. But the subcat list merely summarizes the
valence of a lexical sign, without having any independent life of its own.
It remains unaﬀected in the construction of syntactic phrases, except
that, in virtue of the various identities between subcat list members
and members of valence lists, the subcat list’s members become fully
speciﬁed as the valence list values are identiﬁed with actual subjects,
complements and speciﬁers. Once a complete phrase is constructed, the
lexical head’s subcat list is fully speciﬁed, as indicated in (1), and may
be used as the locus of binding theory.
This redundancy has been broken in recent work. The canonical
relationship between the subcat list and the valence lists is still an
append relationship, but various other possibilities have been explored.

To begin with a simple example, many languages allow arguments to
not be realized, in what is sometimes known as “free pro-drop”, as in
the Japanese sentence (2a):

In this sentence, there is only one surface argument. Recent work has
argued that the supposition of traces or other empty elements is unnecessary to explain wanna ‘contraction’ (Pullum 1997), and stands in
the way of understanding a host of other phenomena thought to legitimate inaudibilia (Sag and Fodor 1994, Sag 1998), and so we would not
want to postulate an empty ‘pro’ element as an independent sign. But
nevertheless one wants to capture how in some sense mi- ‘see’ takes
two arguments. For example, these two arguments need to appear in
a discussion of binding theory when discussing interpretations of this
sentence. One can do this by proposing an ‘object pro-drop’ lexical entry for the verb as shown in (2b), and maintaining the approach that
binding theory operates on the subcat list, not the valence lists.
In this model, the subcat list no longer captures surface subcategorization, but is an attribute of only lexical signs, used to explain
phenomena such as binding, linking, and ‘deep’ subcategorization, and
hence it has become similar to certain notions of argument structure.
Thus, in recent work the subcat list has been renamed as arg-st, and
we will use this name henceforth. But it should be emphasized that
the arg-st list is a syntactic representation, just like its predecessor the
subcat list, and is not to be viewed as a partial semantic representation
or some sort of substitute for one.
Pro-drop is one of a class of cases, together with unbounded dependencies and pronominal aﬃxes, where arguments do not appear on a
valence list (Sag and Fodor 1994, Sag and Godard 1994, Miller and Sag
1997, Bouma et al. 1998). Other recent work has focussed on the analysis
of data that involves somewhat more interesting dissociations between
valency and argument structure than just the valence lists being a subset
of the arg-st list (Manning 1996, Manning et al. in press, Abeill´ et al.
e
to appear). The ability to dissociate argument structure from valence in
this way takes HPSG a certain distance from the monolevel, monostratal
roots of GPSG and early HPSG. The purpose of this paper is to better

66 / Christopher D. Manning and Ivan A. Sag

motivate the existence of two independent syntactic notions of valency
and argument structure and to examine the kinds of dissociations that
can occur, with reference to passives, binding and ergative languages.
While doing that, we will suggest some argument structure representations that diﬀer from those presented previously, and for which there is
interesting empirical support.

5.1

Binding Theory and Passives

The HPSG binding theory is based on hierarchical argument structure
rather than constituent structure (as also in Johnson (1977)). As Pollard
and Sag (1992, 1994) demonstrate, this approach to binding provides
an immediate solution to a variety of dilemmas facing any account of
English binding stated in terms of constituency-based notions such as
c-command. It maintains three binding principles, analogous to those
of GB; they are given informally in (3):2
(3) HPSG Binding Theory:
Principle A. A locally a-commanded anaphor must be locally
a-bound.
Principle B. A personal pronoun must be locally a-free.
Principle C. A non-pronoun must be a-free.
These principles require an anaphor to be coindexed with a less oblique
arg-st member, if there is such a less oblique coargument. Otherwise,
anaphors are free (subject to various discourse and processing considerations) to be bound by appropriate elements in the discourse context.
This binding theory is adequate for English, but crosslinguistic coverage of binding phenomena requires more parametric options (Dalrymple
1993). In many languages, reﬂexives cannot be bound by just any less
oblique (local) NP, but rather their antecedence is restricted to what we
might loosely call “subjects”. At least to a ﬁrst approximation this is
true of languages such as Japanese, Russian, Inuit, and Sanskrit. Given
that the binding theory in HPSG is deﬁned on arg-st (an assumption
that we will later actively argue for), the natural explanation for such
data is to suggest that in these languages, reﬂexives must be bound by
the ﬁrst element on some arg-st list. We will formalize such a notion
with the deﬁnition and principle in (4), drawn from Manning (1996).
(4) a. An a-subject is an entity that is ﬁrst on some arg-st list.
b. A-subject-oriented anaphors must be a-bound by an a-subject.
2 A-command, a-bound, and a-free are the same notions as o-command, o-bound,
and o-free from Pollard and Sag (1994), now deﬁned on arg-st, but the new names
are meant to evoke the argument structure based theory of binding we employ.

Dissociations Between Arg-St and Grammatical Relations / 67

This allows us to explain why Kaali is not a possible binder in the Inuit
example (5):
(5) Juuna-p
Kaali
immi-nik uqaluttuup-p-a-a
Juuna-erg Kaali.abs self-mod tell-ind-tr-3sg.3sg
‘Juunai told Kaalij about selfi/*j .’
A second parametrization of the binding theory is that while classical reﬂexives are clause bounded, many languages allow long distance
reﬂexives. For example, both the Inuit reﬂexive immi and the Japanese
reﬂexive zibun can be bound by any a-commanding a-subject. Such long
distance anaphors might be said to obey Principle Z (Xue et al. 1994):
(6) Principle Z. A locally a-commanded long distance anaphor must
be a-bound.
Now consider the interaction of passive and subject-oriented reﬂexives. If our theory of passive was that drawn from HPSG1 – a lexical
rule that cyclically permuted the subcat, now arg-st, list as in (7):3

then our prediction is clear: the only possible binder of subject-oriented
reﬂexives, the a-subject, is now the NP that is the subject of the passive
( 2 ). However, in many languages, this is not in fact the case. Perlmutter
(1984) observed this for the case of Russian. While in (8a), the reﬂexive
sebe must be bound by the subject, in the passive (8b), the antecedent
can be either the surface subject or the agent argument (sometimes
known as the logical subject, following Jespersen (1924)).
(8) a. Boris

‘Borisi told me a joke about himselfi .’
`
b. Eta kniga

this book.nom was bought Boris.instr for self
‘This book was bought by Borisi for himselfi .’
Perlmutter argued from these data that the passive must have a complex representation of some sort. In particular, Perlmutter used these
examples to argue within Relational Grammar (RG) that both the logical subject and the surface subject of a passive must be a 1 at some
level: the logical subject is the initial 1, while the surface subject is the

ﬁnal 1.
In essence we accept this argument, and suggest that we want a representation for passives (at least in languages like Russian) where both
the surface subject and the logical subject qualify as a-subjects. However, we argue that such an analysis does not require multiple strata of
grammatical relations, as in RG, but can more restrictively be captured
by suggesting that passive lexemes possess a nested argument structure,
which has the immediate result that passive clauses have two a-subjects.4
Indeed, below we will present arguments from ergative languages that
such an alternative analysis in terms of argument structure rather than
grammatical relations is not only possible but necessary.
Various ways have been suggested within HPSG for licensing derived
types, such as the passive lexemes that we are dealing with here. While
any of them could be used to produce a similar analysis to the one presented here, we will develop our account in terms of a theory of derivational types, which specify a declarative relationship between a source
stem and a result stem (which is morphologically ‘derived’ from it).
Such an approach is closely related to what Copestake (1992) proposes
(see also Meurers (1995)). It has the advantages of allowing inheritance
within the hierarchical lexicon of HPSG to extend over both stem and
word types and derivational types (as in the approach of Riehemann
(1993)) while preserving the locality of information and lexical integrity
of words within the syntax that is well-captured within the lexical rules
approach. Thus we will suppose that the universal characterization of
passive is as in (9):5

Such a derivational type is to be read as saying that basic and other
derived lexemes of the source type license additional lexemes of the
result type. We propose that the passive lexeme’s arg-st value is a

passive is intrinsically promotional; some have argued that the universal
rule of passive should only mention subject demotion, to account for passive-like
structures where nothing is promoted, such as in Lithuanian, but we would provide
a diﬀerent (though related) type for such cases.
5 This

list consisting of the second (undergoer) argument of the source lexeme
followed by a list that is the same as the arg-st value of the source,
except that the second element has been replaced by a PRO placeholder.
These placeholder elements in arg-st lists are used to mark positions
coindexed with an element higher in the arg-st, and are needed for
binding, as we will see below. The passive’s arg-st value is thus a
‘nested’ list (a list that contains another list as a member), a fact that
will play a crucial role in our account of constraints on binding.
The passive verb of (8b) will then be:

In (10), the reﬂexive beneﬁciary 5 is inside the nested arg-st list, and
therefore it is a-bound by two a-subjects. This means that if the beneﬁciary 5 is a long distance a-subject-oriented anaphor, then Principle Z
and the a-subject principle can be satisﬁed by 5 being coindexed with
either 1 or 2 , both of which are a-commanders and a-subjects. This is
exactly the result we want to explain the Russian data above. Note that
our theory predicts that the surface subject is another possible binder
of the anaphor in (8b), but this is being ruled out due to its being an
inanimate NP. Similar data that supports this analysis occurs in many
languages; (11) shows a passive from the syntactically ergative language
West Greenlandic Inuit.6 Examples from Sanskrit, Hindi, and Japanese
are discussed by Manning (1996:57,124–127), and Shibatani (1988).

itigartis-sima-ga-a-ni
turn.down-prf-prt.tr-3sg-4sg]
‘Najaj was told by Tobiasi that hek had turned selfi/j down.’
Thus the data from passives that we have examined argues for three
things: (i) that there must be a new more articulated argument structure
for passives along the lines that we have proposed; (ii) that passive must
be stated so as to realign argument structure, not valence lists; and
(iii) that binding possibilities are sensitive to this argument structure,
and not to surface phrase structure or surface valence patterns.
6 As well as lexical reﬂexives, Inuit has a reﬂexive pronominal agreement marker,
here glossed as ‘4th person’, its traditional name. See Manning (1996) for justiﬁcation
of the syntactic ergativity of Inuit.

5.2

Syntactically ergative constructions

In cases of dissociations between argument structure and surface valency, the HPSG architecture predicts that binding possibilities and related phenomena should depend solely on the argument structure and be
independent of valency. This prediction is startlingly conﬁrmed by the
behavior of syntactically ergative and Western Austronesian languages.
This is examined in more detail in Manning (1996), Wechsler and Arka
(to appear), and Wechsler (this volume), but will be illustrated brieﬂy
here, with an eye to the development of an HPSG analysis.
Western Austronesian languages allow various relationships between
argument structure and valence list conﬁguration, mediated by so-called
voice morphology. The best known case of this is Tagalog (Schachter
1976, Kroeger 1993), but here we will present some evidence from Toba
Batak (Schachter 1984), which has a more rigid conﬁgurational surface structure than Tagalog, and hence demonstrates some points more
clearly. In particular, it clearly shows the independence of binding from
surface structure command relationships. Toba Batak has a distinction
between active voice (mang-) and objective voice (di-) forms of verbs:
(12) a. Mang-ida si Ria si Torus
av-see
pm Ria pm Torus
‘Torus sees/saw Ria.’

b. Di-ida si Torus si Ria
ov-see pm Torus pm Ria
‘Torus sees/saw Ria.’

The active voice (12a) has the logical subject of the clause in the clause
ﬁnal subject position, while the objective voice (12b), which tends to
be used in unmarked contexts, has what we might term the Undergoer
(Foley and Van Valin 1984) in subject position. Schachter (1984) provides evidence that both arguments in both voices in (12) are core roles
(as opposed to obliques and adjuncts); see also the more extensive arguments in Kroeger (1993) for Tagalog. Thus the correct analysis is not to
view one of (12a) or (12b) as a passive or antipassive (as has often been
done in the generative literature), but rather as both exhibiting diﬀerent
relationships between argument structure and surface valence. There is
strong evidence that a verb and the following NP of a transitive clause
form a constituent, which we will call a VP, regardless of the verbal voice
chosen. These VPs can be coordinated regardless of their voice:
(13) a. Man-uhor baoang jala mang-olompa mangga halak an
[av-buy
onions] and [av-cook
mangoes] man
‘The man buys onions and cooks mangoes.’
b. Di-tuhor si Ore jala di-lompa si Ruli mangga
[ov-buy pm Ore] and [ov-cook pm Ruli] mangoes
‘Ore buys and Ruli cooks mangoes.’

Dissociations Between Arg-St and Grammatical Relations / 71

Other arguments are that an adverb cannot appear in the middle of
the VP between the verb and the NP, though adverbs can generally
occur between other major constituents, and that the pitch accent of a
sentence occurs on the last stressed syllable of this VP, in both voices,
including on the verb of an intransitive sentence (Emmorey 1984). Thus
the ﬁrst NP of transitive clauses will be analyzed as being on the comps
list and will combine with the verb as a head-complement phrase.
Conversely, the ﬁnal NP in the examples above will be analyzed as a
VP-external subject. This NP behaves similarly to the ang-marked NP
in Tagalog. It may optionally be fronted before the verb in questions or
as a topic, while the VP-internal NP may not be. Further, as in Tagalog,
relativization is restricted to this NP, and following the Keenan-Comrie
(1977) hierarchy, if only one NP can be relativized on, then that NP is
the subject. Moreover it is this VP-external subject NP that must be
the controllee, regardless of the verbal voice:
(14) a. Mang-elek si Bill si John [man-uhor biang ]
av-persuade pm Bill pm John av-buy
dog
‘John is persuading Bill to buy a dog.’
b. Mang-elek si Bill si John [di-pareso doktor ]
av-persuade pm Bill pm John ov-examine doctor
‘John is persuading Bill to have a doctor examine him.’
This suggests an analysis of (12b) as in (15), and lexical entries for the
verbs in (12a) and (12b) as in (16a) and (16b), respectively.

However, despite this clear evidence for phrase structure and grammatical relations, reﬂexive binding is insensitive to this structure. Reﬂexivization shows that an a-subject can bind a non-a-subject (and not
vice versa) regardless of the verbal voice of the sentence (Sugamoto
1984):
(17) a. [Mang-ida diri-na] si John
av-saw self-his pm John
‘Johni saw himselfi .’

b. *[Mang-ida si John] diri-na
av-saw pm John self-his
*‘Himselfi saw Johni .’

(18) a. *[Di-ida diri-na] si John
b. [Di-ida si John] diri-na
ov-saw self-his pm John
ov-saw pm John self-his
‘Johni saw himselfi .’
*‘Himselfi saw Johni .’
To account for these reﬂexivization patterns using a surface structure
based notion of command would mean suggesting that the phrase structures of the sentences in (17) and (18) are radically diﬀerent. But all
available evidence indicates that the phrase structure is the same despite
the changing verbal voice. On the other hand, these facts just fall out of
the HPSG theory of binding. For instance, although the NP si John does
not c-command the reﬂexive in (18b), it nevertheless a-commands the
reﬂexive – the structure of this example is identical to (15). Thus these
data provide startling support for deﬁning binding theory on a level of
argument structure that is distinct from both surface phrase structure
and valence lists.7

5.3

Generating diﬀerent linking patterns

Finally we will discuss brieﬂy how the various diﬀerent patterns of mapping between argument structure and the valence lists can be licensed.
We can seek to explain both the commonality of types like intransitive
verbs and transitive verbs across all languages and the systematic link7 See further Manning (1996) and Wechsler and Arka (to appear) for arguments
and evidence that these binding facts cannot be explained simply by reference to a
thematic hierarchy, as is argued for in Schachter (1984) and Sugamoto (1984). See
also Davis (1996) and Davis and Koenig (1996) for general evidence against the use
of thematic hierarchies.

Dissociations Between Arg-St and Grammatical Relations / 73

ing diﬀerences between syntactically ergative and accusative languages
through the use of multiple inheritance within a hierarchical lexicon
(Pollard and Sag 1987, Riehemann 1993). That is, in a syntactically
accusative language, a transitive verb will say both that it is transitive,
and that it obeys an accusative linking pattern, and so on. A partial
presentation of some necessary types is presented in (19). Note in particular that types like intrans-v-lxm and trans-v-lxm only specify the
arg-st list of their type, and say nothing about the valence lists.8

Before, we suggested that a canonical lexeme is one where the valence lists ‘add up’ to the arg-st. We wish to maintain this intuition,
but also to allow for recent work on the treatment of causatives and light
verbs, and on the handling of syntactically ergative and Western Austronesian languages. In (19e–f), we therefore introduce a generalization
8 We assume a division among the arguments of a verb into core and oblique
arguments (Manning 1996). In most languages, all verbs have a subject, and so the
language would make all verbs subj-v-lxm, but we allow for subjectless verbs in the
initial verb type. The disjunction in (19f) appears necessary. In syntactically ergative
languages, with intransitive verbs, the ﬁrst argument on the arg-st list becomes the
subject, whereas with transitive verbs, it is the second argument on the arg-st list
that becomes the subject.

74 / Christopher D. Manning and Ivan A. Sag

of this notion, whereby the subj and comps lists are allowed to add
up in certain constrained ways to a list that is the compression of the
argument structure, that is, what it ‘ﬂattens out’ to once we promote
the members of its embedded lists to be on a par with the other list
members, eliminating embedded PROs in the process. See Manning et
al. (in press) for further discussion and exempliﬁcation.9
Not all languages consistently maintain the relationship whereby the
arg-st list is the append of the subj, spr, and comps lists, in that
order . Rather, in Western Austronesian languages, another ordering is
possible, and indeed is unmarked. In this pattern, it is the second core
argument of the arg-st of a transitive verb that becomes the subj. In
syntactically ergative languages, the unmarked relationship in Philippine languages is the only relationship possible for expressing transitive
verbs (Dixon 1994, Manning 1996). These languages, and the Western Austronesian languages, provide strong support for two independent syntactic levels, realized in HPSG3 by the valence lists and arg-st,
and provide crucial evidence for the argument structure based theory of
binding that HPSG provides.
The relation between argument structure and the valence lists is
handled by separate types (19e–f), which cross-classify with the arity
or polyadicity types. A verb in a particular language will then inherit
its subcategorization type, and one of the types in (19e–f). For an accusative language like English, a transitive verb would have a type like
(20a), for a syntactically ergative language like Inuit, there would be a
transitive verb type like (20b), while a Western Austronesian language
like Toba Batak would allow both these constructions via a transitive
verb type like (20c). The type in (20c) (along with verb-particular information) will then license the two Toba Batak signs that were shown
in (16).

compression( P RO|Y ) = Z ← compression(Y ) = Z.
compression( X|Y ) = X|Z ← X is a synsem, compression(Y ) = Z.
compression( X|Y ) = Z ← X is a list, compression(X) = X ,
compression(Y ) = Y , append(X , Y ) = Z.

Conclusion

We have argued that HPSG must draw a fundamental distinction between argument structure and the valence features which Borsley proposed, which distinguish grammatical relations. We have examined, unfortunately superﬁcially, data from a range of languages to try to show
that one can use this argument-structure list to considerable linguistic advantage. This in turn seems to alter the character of HPSG, by
providing an important second kind of organization on the dependents
of lexical heads. In particular, we discussed how theories of grammar
that deﬁne binding on surface phrase structure conﬁgurations or surface
valence lists are unable to satisfactorily account for binding patterns
seen in Austronesian and ergative languages, or the binding patterns of
‘subject-oriented’ reﬂexives when they occur with passive or causative
verbs. Following the reasoning laid out in slightly diﬀerent terms in
Manning (1996), we have argued that it is possible to give a universal
characterization of binding in terms of our notion of argument structure
that generalizes nicely over accusative and ergative languages, and that
correctly predicts binding patterns with passive – and causative – verbs.
In the process of developing this account, we have been led to a number of more speciﬁc proposals about the nature of passives and argument
realization or linking. A perspicuous way of formulating these proposals seems to be in terms of a small set of universally available types
and constraints associated with them (also universal, we might hope).
Although the ideas sketched here are preliminary, we hope that they
can serve as a basis for subsequent HPSG research that will try to distill generalizations from seemingly diverse cross-linguistic patterns like
these and to organize them into a tight system of universally available
types and simple constraints. The recognition of argument structure as
an independent dimension of grammatical organization seems to be an
important ﬁrst step to take in the realization of this goal.
