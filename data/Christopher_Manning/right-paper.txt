11 August 1997
Abeill´ and Godard (1994) seek to show that the rightward branching analysis of French tense
e
auxiliaries shown in (1b), that I argued for in Manning (1992) and which is widely adopted in
general, is wrong, and that rather we should adopt a ﬂat analysis for this construction as shown in
(1c), and they show how such an analysis can be realized within HPSG (Pollard and Sag 1994).

However, I believe that the evidence available still on balance favours the rightward-branching
phrase structure, and so I will attempt to show in this paper why that structure is to be preferred
and how there are responses to the points made in Abeill´ and Godard (1994). I hope that this
e
argument will seem convincing. If not, I seek still to establish a weaker point, namely to suggest
that “There’s more than one way to do it” (Wall and Schwartz 1994:xx). While Abeill´ and Godard
e
(1994) present many of their arguments as framework-independent arguments in favour of a ﬂat
structure, the truth is that in general this is not so. Indeed, I doubt that there is such a thing
as framework-independent evidence for a particular syntactic structure. While some arguments
1

adduced from data are more theory internal than others, I think evidence is only applicable across
frameworks to the extent that frameworks share certain (often covert) assumptions. Below we will
see that several of their supposedly framework-independent arguments actually are not applicable
to an LFG analysis of phrase structure. Indeed towards the end, I wish to speculate a little about
whether they are arguments about phrase structure at all, or whether they are really just showing
the monoclausality of French periphrastic tenses. This will be considered in the context of the rise
of linearization-based approaches within HPSG (Reape 1994, Pollard et al. 1993, Kathol 1995a),
and their relationship to LFG (Manning 1995).

1

Arguments and counterarguments

Abeill´ and Godard (1994) – henceforth A&G – present four arguments against a rightwarde
branching structure for French tense auxiliaries. I present my perspective on them all here, although I wish to consider these matters not merely within the context of French tense auxiliaries
but within the larger domain of Romance complex predicates/restructuring constructions in general (A&G themselves note that “the core cases of faire illustrate the same structure” and similar
HPSG structures have been employed by Monachesi (1993) for restructuring verbs in Italian).

1.1

Lack of VP movement, deletion, and pronominalization

The ﬁrst argument is that while the inﬁnitival VP complement of regular complement-taking verbs
can be pronominalized, (unfelicitously?) deleted, or can appear separately (2), such structures are
not possible with the putative VP complement of the tense auxiliaries, as shown in (3).
(2) a. Jean peut venir, mais il ne le veut pas
‘Jean can come but he doesn’t want it.’
b. Marie a voulu visiter le mus´e, mais moi, je n’ai pas voulu.
e
‘Marie wanted to visit the museum, but me, I didn’t want to.’
c. Que veut-elle? Partir.
‘What does she want? To go away.’
(3) a. *Jean n’est pas arriv´ hier ` l’heure au rendez-vous, mais Marie l’est.
e
a
‘Jean arrived on time at the meeting yesterday, but Marie didn’t.’
b. *Marie a visit´ le mus´e, mais moi, je n’ai pas.
e
e
‘Marie visited the museum, but me, I didn’t.’
c. *Qu’a-t-elle? Vendu ses livres.
‘What has she? Sold her books.’
Thus French periphrastic tenses do not provide the kind of classic arguments for a rightward
branching VP structure that commonly appear in introductory syntax textbooks for English (Radford 1988). Indeed, A&G take this contrast to suggest that the phrase structure of French tense
auxiliaries is fundamentally diﬀerent. However, while these constructions do not provide evidence

2

for a nested VPs constituency for French tense auxiliaries, absence of evidence is not evidence of absence. It would in general be too naive to say that we could only postulate constituents where they
can be moved or deleted as a block since other principles of grammar constrain what is acceptable.
I believe that the observations above about French should be linked up with facts from Italian,
Spanish, and Catalan, in which not only auxiliaries, but a rather nebulous class of other verbs with
modal and aspectual meaning optionally show a close relationship with the following verb (phrase)
(4). Evidence for this close relationship is shown both by the presence of a a clitic on the modal
that semantically belongs to the lower verb and by the change of perfective auxiliary to essere (see
Rizzi (1982), Manning (1992), and below for further discussion).
(4) Maria c’` dovuta venire molte volte.
e
‘Maria there “is” had to come many times.’
Using a transformational approach, Rizzi (1982) dubbed such verbs as having undergone a process
of ‘restructuring’. I seek a non-transformational, declarative description of what is happening, and
will refer to these constructions as complex predicate constructions. In such constructions, the ﬁnal
verb will be termed the heavy verb and earlier verbs and auxiliaries will be referred to as light verbs.
My analysis is that tense auxiliaries in French are verbs that necessarily form complex predicates
with the following verb (phrase).
Note that the same kind of prohibitions on movement, pronominalization, and deletion are
found with the complement of light verbs in Italian. Since restructuring is optional with verbs
other than auxiliaries, we would expect processes of complement pronominalization, deletion or
separation to occur when these verbs are used as main verbs, but for these processes not to cooccur
when other diagnostics of complex predicate formation are present. Two diagnostics of complex
predicate formation in Italian are clitic climbing and that the choice of the perfective auxiliary
reﬂects the transitivity of not the light verb but the following heavy verb. Normally clitics in
Italian remain with the verb they are semantically dependent on (5a–b), but members of this class
of modal and aspectual verbs can either behave as regular (heavy) verbs (5c) or they can be light
verb in which case clitic climbing usually occurs (5d).
(5) a. Piero aﬀermava di conoscer-la molto bene.
Peter says
‘of’ to.know-her very well
‘Peter says he knows her very well.’
b. *Piero la aﬀermava di conoscere molto bene.
c. Maria ﬁnisce di batter-la a macchina domani.
Maria ﬁnishes ‘of’ to.hit-it on machine tomorrow
‘Mary ﬁnishes typing it tomorrow’
d. Maria la ﬁnisce di battere a macchina domani.
Secondly, in Italian there is an alternation in the expression of the perfective auxiliary with essere
being used with unaccusative verbs and avere being used elsewhere (see Rizzi (1982) and especially
Burzio (1986)).
(6) a. Piero ha/*` mangiato con noi
e
‘Piero has/*‘is’ eaten with us.’

3

b. Piero ha/*` voluto questo libro
e
‘Piero has/*‘is’ wanted this book.’
c. Piero *ha/` venuto con noi
e
‘Piero *has/‘is’ come with us.’
The facts of present interest are what happens when a restructuring verb that takes avere as its
auxiliary, like volere in (6b), takes a verbal complement:
(7) a. Piero ha/*` voluto mangiare con noi
e
‘Piero has/*‘is’ wanted to eat with us.’
b. Piero ha/` voluto venire con noi
e
‘Piero has/‘is’ wanted to come with us.’
Avere is always good, but if the downstairs verb would normally take essere, then essere is
also possible.1 Importantly for present purposes, Rizzi (1982) discusses how, if other evidence
shows that restructuring has occurred (for example, the occurrence of clitic-climbing), then essere
is necessarily used as the auxiliary, as shown in (8). Conversely, if restructuring cannot occur,
auxiliary change is impossible.
(8) a.

Maria c’` dovuta venire molte volte.
e
‘Maria there “is” had to come many times.’

b. *?Maria ci ha dovuto venire molte volte
‘Maria has had to come there many times.’
Now notice that Italian has various constructions such such as VP pied-piping accompanying
Wh-movement (9a–b) and cleft formation (9c) that can move an inﬁnitival VP (which can be the
complement of one of these modal or aspectual verbs).
(9) a. Questi argomenti, [a discutere dei quali] verr` al pi` presto, mi sembrano molto
o
u
interessanti.
‘These topics, to discuss (on) which, I will come as soon as possible, seem to me very
interesting.’
b. La casa paterna, [tornare
alla quale Maria avrebbe
voluto gi`
a
da
the house paternal return.inf to the which Maria have.cond wanted already since
molto tempo], . . .
much time
‘Her paternal home, to which Maria would have wanted to go back for a long time, . . . ’
c. E’ [ad arretrare vistosamente] che la truppe hanno cominciato.
‘It is to draw back considerably that the troops have begun.’
However, this is only possible if these verbs are serving as regular heavy verbs. As Rizzi (1982)
discusses, such movements are inconsistent with diagnostics of complex predicate formation such as
clitic climbing (10a) or auxiliary change (10b–c). Since these constructions are possible only with
volere acting as a main (heavy) verb, there cannot be an auxiliary change in (10b–c).
1

Restructuring verbs that take essere as an auxiliary always maintain this auxiliary. I will not further discuss
this point, but it in no way undermines the point that is being made.

4

(10) a. *Questi argomenti, a parlare dei quali ti verr` al pi` presto, . . .
o
u
‘These topics, to talk with you about which I will come as soon as possible, . . . .’
b. *La casa paterna, [tornare
alla quale Maria sarebbe
voluta gi`
a
da
the house paternal return.inf to the which Maria ‘be’.cond wanted already since
molto tempo], . . .
much time
‘Her paternal home, to which Maria would have wanted to go back for a long time, . . . ’
c. *E’ [ad arretrare vistosamente] che la truppe sono cominciato.
‘It is to draw back considerably that the troops have begun.’
Thus we note that in Italian there is evidence for an inﬁnitival VP serving as complement to
modal and aspectual verbs, and for its ability to move/appear fronted. Nevertheless, we see that
this possibility cannot be combined with complex predicate formation. Now one possibility is that
this diﬀerence is to be accounted for by proposing a radically diﬀerent phrase structure in the
cases where complex predicate formation has taken place, as A&G propose. But I would prefer to
suggest that this is instead to be accounted for simply by showing that VP topicalization of this
sort is inconsistent with complex predicate formation (quite independently of any choices of phrase
structure for verbal complementation).2
Given the feature-sharing operations available in modern constraint-based grammar frameworks
it is quite possible to implement the distinction between complex predicate structures and regular
complementation structures by other means than proposing a diﬀerent phrase structure for the two
cases, and I will argue below that such an alternative is desirable. I do not wish to dally on a complete analysis of Italian pied-piping or cleft formation, but I think there is a quite straightforward
approach within LFG to why these constructions are inconsistent with complex predicate formation.
In a sentence like (9a), the displaced pied-piped material would have a discourse function as the
focus of the clause (Bresnan and Mchombo 1987). Firstly, if we suppose that possession of a discourse function is inconsistent with sharing of grammatical relations (just as Andrews and Manning
(1993) argue that having a grammatical function is inconsistent with the sharing of grammatical
relations), then this alone is suﬃcient to rule out complex predicate formation in this case.3 But
secondly, note that the focused material should be identiﬁed with its role in the clause by means of
a functional uncertainty expression (Kaplan and Zaenen 1989). Such an expression should say what
grammatical function the discourse function has within the sentence. But the key to our analysis is
that the VP complement to a light verb does not bear a grammatical function (but rather is part
of a domain over which grammatical functions are shared), and this makes the construction of such
a functional uncertainty path impossible (Alsina 1993:240). Similarly the clefted material will gain
a grammatical function in the matrix clause, and complex predicate formation will be blocked.4
2

A&G (p. 159) indeed seem to realize the weakness of this argument, noting that:
There may well exist independent reasons for which each of these constructions is impossible. Yet, it
must be acknowledged that the structure proposed [the rightward-branching structure] is not supported
by syntactic tests.

3

See Andrews and Manning (1993) for details, but the essential idea is that the monoclausality of complex
predicates is to be captured by saying that they are a multi-predicate domain over which grammatical relations are
shared.
4
A similar approach could be applied to le-pronominalization, but note that the failure of le-pronominalization
may be for reasons other than that the complement of the tense auxiliary is not a constituent: as Kayne (1975:299)

5

1.2

Bounded dependencies and causatives

A&G’s third and fourth arguments turn on similar questions. The observations are that a sequence
of a tense auxiliary and a following verb (phrase) functions in some sense as a single clause, rather
than as clausal embedding. They note that tough constructions and ` inﬁnitival relative clauses
a
are strictly clause bounded in French (as they are in other Romance languages), as shown in (11).
(11) a. Cette chanson est facile ` apprendre.
a
‘This song is easy to learn.’
b. *Cette chanson est facile ` promettre d’apprendre
a
‘This song is easy to promise to learn.’
Similarly, for example, in Spanish, one cannot form a long distance tough construction with cases
of regular verbal complementation (12):
(12) *Tales cosas son dif´
ıciles de insistir en hacer
‘Such things are diﬃcult to insist on doing.’
A&G then proceed to note that tough constructions and ` inﬁnitival relatives do occur with French
a
periphrastic tenses. Similarly, apparently long distance tough constructions appear in Spanish just
in cases where complex predicate formation is possible:
(13) Estos mapas ser´n dif´
a
ıciles de empezar a hacer
‘These maps will be diﬃcult to begin to make.’
But these arguments crucially depend on the assumption that the distinction between monoclausal complex predicate constructions and regular multiclause complementation constructions
cannot be captured unless they are given diﬀerent phrase structures. But in a framework like
LFG the distinction at hand is most appropriately captured by giving French periphrastic tenses
(and light verb constructions in Romance more generally) a representation that is monoclausal
at f-structure, whereas regular VP-complement constructions have a representation that is multiclausal at f-structure. This is because f-structure is the appropriate place in LFG to capture the
deﬁning property of complex predicates: that they are domains with a single array of grammatical
relations (Manning 1992, Andrews and Manning 1993, Butt 1995). But these diﬀerent f-structure
representations only weakly constrain possible surface phrase structure representations for these
structures. In particular, they do not preclude a rightward-branching source for complex predicate
constructions, as we will see below.

1.3

Manner adverbs

This leaves only some very interesting data from manner adverbs which initially do appear challenging to an LFG analysis that employs a rightward-branching phrase structure. A&G note that
there is a class of manner adverbs which can appear between the tense auxiliary and the participle
(14a), but not sentence initially (14b). They argue that their behaviour is inconsistent with the
rightward-branching VP analysis. They suggest that these adverbs cannot be left adjoined to the
lower VP because (unlike some other adverb classes) they cannot appear before a VP in other
notes, le-pronominalization is not accepted or marginal for a variety of other governing verbs.

6

contexts such as a participial absolute (14c) or a fronted inﬁnitival clause (14d), and they cannot
be a daughter of the higher VP because they cannot take wide scope over a coordination of lower
VPs (14e) and such a proposal would wrongly predict a word order that allowed temporal adverbs
to follow manner adverbs (14f) given that there is independent evidence that the former can left
adjoin to a VP (14g).
(14) a.

Jean a attentivement ´cout´ son professeur.
e
e
‘Jean listened attentively to his teacher.’

b. ??Attentivement, Jean a ´cout´ son professeur
e
e
‘Attentively, Jean listened to his teacher.’
c. ??Bruyamment sortis, les d´put´s on fait connaˆ leur d´sapprobation.
e e

e
‘Loudly gone out, the M.P.s made their disapproval known.’
d. *Attentivement prendre des notes ne suﬃt pas ` faire un bon ´tudiant.

‘To attentively take notes is not suﬃcient to make one a good student.’
e.

e

‘Jean listened attentively to his teach and took notes (*attentively).’

f. ??Jean a bruyamment imm´diatement contre-attaqu´.

e
‘Jean loudly immediately counter-attacked.’
g.

Imm´diatement descendu, il a pu appr´cier les d´gˆts.
e
e
e a
‘Immediately gone down, he could evaluate the damage.’

This is an interesting set of data, and in this section I will provide some tentative remarks
about how these data might be handled in an LFG account that uses rightward-branching nested VP
phrase structures. Although the argument from coordination (14e) depends on certain assumptions
about how adverb scope is handled, I do take it as a powerful indication that the adverb does not
appear in the higher VP, and therefore would adopt a phrase structure along the lines of (15) for
(14a) (glossing over whether the adverb is simply the leftmost member of the expansion of the VP
or forms an adjunction structure, possibly with either the VP or just the V):
(15)

S
NP
Jean

VP
V

VP

a

attentivement ´cout´ son professeur
e
e

If our expansion of the VP rule or possibilities for adjunction license this structure, then the question
is how can we exclude the possibilities in (14c–d). In particular, (14c) shows that the exclusion
cannot be based on the verbal form (vform feature) of the VP in which it appears. But actually
things are somewhat more subtle than this, because within the theory of Andrews and Manning
(1993) and Andrews (1996), the adverb is within a domain of shared grammatical relations with a
ﬁnite verb. That is, they share all features of the f-projection. So one possibility would be to say
that the adverb can only left adjoin to a participial verb (phrase) if it is within a ﬁnite f-projection.
7

An alternative would be to work simply with linear order, taking the basic generalization to be
that some word of the verb complex should precede the manner adverb. Such a proposal could be
worked out using the notion of relativized f-precedence from Zaenen and Kaplan (1995).
These remarks may appear a little tentative and unconvincing (and indeed a fuller account of
adverb placement possibilities is called for), but at any rate it is important to realize that at present
these data in no way provide an argument for preferring A&G’s HPSG account to the LFG account
being assumed here (a fuller version of which appears in Andrews and Manning (1993)). A&G do
not return to a full consideration of the adverb data within the HPSG account that they present,
and most importantly their account, as presented, would incorrectly generate ill-formed examples
such as (15c) which are the only evidence against a structure where the adverb appears as the
leftmost element of a complement VP. Therefore, while these data deserve fuller consideration,
they are not (yet) an argument for choosing one approach over another.

2

In favour of the right branching analysis

In this section I present the arguments and concerns that lead me to adopt a right-branching phrase
structure for French tense auxiliaries and other cases of restructuring. These arguments address
three main areas: (i) concerns for a restrictive universal theory of both phrase structure and the
mapping between phrase structure and functional structure within LFG, (ii) issues in the treatment
of coordination, and (iii) extendability to other cases of complex predicates.

2.1

Universals of phrase structure

A basic goal of generative linguistics is to provide a constrained theory of phrase structure conﬁgurations. Within recent LFG (Bresnan forthcoming) this is generally done by assuming a modiﬁed
form of X -licensing (the modiﬁcations essentially provide for the optional realization of heads and
non-heads so as to obviate the need for the movements used in GB versions of X theory). Such
concerns for a restrictive theory of surface phrase structure would suggest as the null hypothesis
a rightward-branching structure for complex predicates, as well as multiclausal VP complement
constructions, since the local tree shown in (16) is in general well-attested. It is the default phrase
structure not only for all cases of complementation but also for constructions like these where there
are functional co-heads.
(16)

VP
V

VP

In contrast, the kind of ﬂat phrase structure that A&G propose is not broadly motivated. Indeed,
if there are other ways to treat the data that they analyze in this way, then this possibility might
be excluded from UG entirely.
Another respect in which I regard a rightward-branching structure as the null-hypothesis is
with respect to the optionally light modal and aspectual verbs of Italian and Spanish. Contrary to
common assertions that optionally light verbs can be lexically listed, Napoli (1981) shows that the
membership of this class is extremely ﬂuid: while certain verbs regularly appear as light verbs, many
other verbs occasionally appear in complex predicate constructions depending on subtle features of
the aspect and conceptualization of the event. The fact that verbs can slip so easily between being
light verbs and heavy verbs suggests that they should have minimally diﬀerent representations.
8

Assuming the same phrase structure for both, as in the LFG account of Andrews and Manning
(1993) is a step in this direction. The diﬀerence in LFG between the light and heavy forms reduces
to a diﬀerence in functional annotations, rather than having to say that the two cases have radically
diﬀerent phrase structures (and rather diﬀerent lexical entries).

2.2

Coordination

However, the best evidence for the lower nested VPs being constituents comes from examining
conjunction (the facts that we consider in this section come from Kayne (1975:97), though he was
unable to provide a satisfactory interpretation for them within his model which involved gapping
following sentential conjunction (see Miller 1991)). With simplex verb forms, a clitic cannot have
wide scope over two conjuncts. The clitic must be repeated as shown in the examples below:
(17) a. Paul la d´teste et la consid`re comme fort bˆte
e
e
e
‘Paul hates her and considers her very stupid.’
b. *Paul la d´teste et consid`re comme fort bˆte
e
e
e
c. Paul te bousculera et te poussera contre Marie
‘Paul will bump into you and push you against Marie.’
d. *Paul te bousculera et poussera contre Marie
Miller observes that this is strong evidence for verbal ‘clitics’ being aﬃxes rather than clitics, as
clitics usually can take wide scope in this way (contrast English John and Mary’ll eat together
tonight). At any rate further examination of this phenomenon gives us compelling evidence for
embedded rightward-branching VPs. For we observe that in compound tenses, just this sort of
wide scope becomes possible:5
(18) a. Paul m’a bouscul´ et pouss´ contre Marie
e
e
‘Paul bumped into me and pushed me against Marie.’
b. Paul l’a insult´ et mis ` la porte
e
a
‘Paul insulted him and threw him out.’
c. La bonne femme les a cuits au four et fait manger ` son ﬁls
a
‘The woman cooked them in the oven and had her son eat them.’
Here the clitic is and must be interpreted as also being an argument of the second verb (which
subcategorizes for a direct object). I would argue that it is very hard to make sense of this contrast
between simple and compound verb tenses under the ﬂat structure proposal of A&G. A&G do
not provide an explicit account of this data but suggest that it is an instance of non-constituent
coordination, parallel to an example like (19), and that there is “a ﬂat structure for the VPs . . .
with the Aux taking as complement the concatenation of the two complement lists”.
(19) Paul donnera un livre ` Gilles et un disque ` Henriette.
a
a
‘Paul will give a book to Gilles and a record to Henriette.’
5
Of course, possible does not mean necessary; repeating the clitics and auxiliaries is also perfectly good: Paul
m’a bouscul´ et m’a pouss´ contre Marie. Such a sentence would be analyzed as (maximal) VP conjunction in a way
e
e
exactly parallel to the examples in (17a,c).

9

I confess to being a little confused about precisely what A&G intend, but nevertheless I would
like to make two points that I think argue against any instantiation of this approach. From an
empirical point of view I wish to argue that this does not appear to be non-constituent coordination,
and then, more from the viewpoint of HPSG theory, I wish to suggest that there is a serious
technical problem in combining the ‘argument composition’ (or, better, division categories) analysis
of Hinrichs and Nakazawa (1994) with coordination constructions in this way.
Under the assumption of a ﬂat VP and non-constituent coordination, we have to suppose a
gapped structure for these coordinations something like this:
(20)

S
NP

VP

Paul

VP

Conj

V

V

m’a

VP

et

V

bouscul´
e

PP

pouss´
e

contre Marie

A corresponding structure for the coordination of verbs in simple tenses would presumably be as
in (21). Such sentences are ungrammatical (17b,d), but there seems to be no sensible way to make
structure (21) ungrammatical while continuing to admit structure (20). Any form of gapping or
interpretation scheme that would allow a structure such as (20) would surely also admit the simpler
structure shown in (21) but this is the wrong result.
(21)

However, we can make perfect sense of the ungrammaticality of (17b,d) if we assume the
rightward-branching structures shown in (22). In (22a) the object clitic is higher up and necessarily has scope over all conjuncts, whereas with a simple tense form, we have a phrase structure
as in (22b). Now, the clitic is inside one of the conjuncts and so we expect this sentence to be
bad because the subcategorization requirements of the verb in the righthand conjunct have been
violated.

Bratt (1990:41) contests this test for constituency, also suggesting that we could be dealing with
non-constituent coordination, citing degraded acceptability when there are non-parallel conjuncts,
but the data do not seem to square with cases of non-constituent coordination. In a paradigm case
of non-constituent coordination, various ‘components’ can be repeated in the second conjunct and
the rest appear to be syntactically or semantically reconstructed, as shown in (23).
(23) a. Paul gave the cassettes to Marie on Wednesday and the CDs on Thursday.
b. Paul gave the cassettes to Marie on Wednesday and to Kim on Thursday
c. Paul gave the cassettes to Marie on Wednesday and the CDs to Kim on Thursday.
We would thus predict that it should be possible to introduce a diﬀerent direct object into the
second conjunct. But this is not the case: it is necessary to gap arguments that are realized as
clitics on the verbal auxiliary in all conjuncts, as shown in (24).
(24) a. *Paul l’a frapp´ et mis sa soeur ` la porte
e
a
‘Paul struck him and threw his sister out.’
b. *Je lui ai parl´ et ´crit ` sa femme
e
e
a
‘I spoke to him and wrote to his wife.’
Again this makes perfect sense if one adopts the rightward-branching structure shown in (22a).
The clitic on the auxiliary must distribute over both conjuncts; it cannot play a role in just one.
Moreover, note that the construction we are dealing with is not an allowed type of nonconstituent
coordination in English. Compare this example and its English translation:
(25) Paul m’a bouscul´ et pouss´ contre Marie
e
e
‘Paul bumped into me and pushed me against Marie.’
Note how in the English translation, me must be repeated in each conjunct. If the second me is
omitted, the meaning of the sentence is completely changed: it cannot retain the same meaning via
semantic reconstruction. To the extent that non-constituent coordination is parallel between English and French, this is an unexpected result under a theory that pins this data on non-constituent
coordination.
Again this set of observations apply not only to the tense auxiliaries in French. Similar conjunction facts hold for causatives and for restructuring verbs in other Romance languages. For
example, embedded VPs can be conjoined after faire in French (26a) and after restructuring verbs
in Spanish (26b–c).
(26) a. Marie le fera lire ` Jean et d´chirer par Paul
a
e
‘Marie will make Jean read it and Paul tear it up.’
11

b. Carlos me sigui´ topando y empujando contra Mar´
o
ıa
‘Carlos kept on bumping into me and pushing me against Mar´
ıa.’
c. Carlos me estaba tratando de topar y de empujar contra Mar´
ıa
‘Carlos was trying to bump into me and push me against Mar´
ıa.’
Note, here, that prepositional markers (e.g., de) are repeated on each conjoined inﬁnitive. Under
Miller’s analysis, this would be indicative of these markers also being inﬂectional aﬃxes. The
arguments for a rightward branching VP analysis are perhaps stronger with some of these light
verbs since I believe that they cannot be gapped in other circumstances (whereas French tense
auxiliaries sometimes can be).

2.3

A technical problem for the HPSG ‘function composition’ approach

There remains one other issue in the HPSG treatment of coordination in the presence of ‘function
composition’ auxiliaries that strikes me as problematic. Consider a sentence such as (27a). Under
the function composition approach, the auxiliary verb would be given a lexical entry such as (27b)
so that it would combine with the heavy verb and inherit its complements, which would then be
discharged as sisters of the auxiliary. But what happens then when there is a coordination, as in
(27c)?

It appears that any attempt to ‘share’ the auxiliary between the ﬁrst and second conjuncts (regardless of whether this involves the rightward-branching analysis or reconstructing a second copy of the
auxiliary under the non-constituent coordination analysis) would lead to problems in the presence
of the lexical division categories analysis of auxiliaries because contradictory subcategorization requirements will be placed on the auxiliary. In particular, here the ﬁrst conjunct subcategorizes for
one complement, while the second conjunct subcategorizes for two. This problem (noted in passing
in Kathol (1995b)) deserves further attention.
However, this example is straightforwardly handled in LFG (for example, under the constituent
coordination proposal of Kaplan and Maxwell (1988)). The coordination introduces a set of fstructures to represent the sentence, and the subject and information from the auxiliary (including
clitics, if present) is distributed over the elements of the set, as shown schematically in (28).

On the other hand, I should not conclude this section without mentioning that some things
that I had earlier thought problematic for verbal complex and ﬂat analyses of these Romance
constructions have turned out not to be problems, and my earlier assertions show only limitations
of my analytic creativity. For instance, I had tended to feel that the way the negative ne . . .
pas wraps itself around the ﬁrst verbal word had a more natural explanation under a rightwardbranching analysis than under the ﬂat analysis. But the neat account of the distribution of pas in
Kim and Sag (1995, 1996) shows that this is not so.

Colloquial Italian

However, Rizzi (1982:35–36) mentions a special case of restructuring in Italian that I think does give
further powerful support for separating the concept of whether something is or is not a complex
predicate from issues of phrase structure. Unfortunately, the phenomenon is rather restricted,
occurring in limited contexts only in colloquial Italian, but the data is very suggestive and so I
will mention it here. The phenomenon is that complex predicates can occur that involve the verb
sapere which takes a CP complement. So we get the data in (29). The structure of (29b) is
presumably roughly as in (30). Various details of this proposed structure are open to question, but
unimportant. However, I take it as beyond question that sapere is here taking a full complement
clause – a CP or its equivalent in other theories. On the other hand, note the clitic climbing which
is deﬁnitive evidence of complex predicate formation.
(29) a. Su questo punto, non ti saprei che dire.
‘On this point, I you wouldn’t know what to tell.’
b. ?Mario, non lo saprei a chi aﬃdare, durante le vacanze.
‘Mario, I him wouldn’t know to whom to entrust, during my holidays.’

I believe such data have no natural explanation in the argument composition approach (if
argument composition is taken to represent the surface phrase structure – more on this below).
Such data suggests rather that complex predicate formation is a more abstract process that must
be somewhat divorced from a particular phrase structure conﬁguration. We want to be able to
say that although such sentences preserve the same surface phrase structure as other instances of
CP complementation, that, marginally, the CP can cease to be a comp at f-structure, but instead
form a complex predicate with the characteristic sharing of grammatical relations across the whole
domain. I also believe stronger evidence for the LFG separation of c-structure and f-structure can
be found in other languages. For example, Butt (1995) shows that Urdu has complex predicates
without any requirement of adjacency between a light verb and its heavy dependent verb. Moreover,
she shows that the permissive light verb and verbs of telling have the same surface phrase structure,
but diﬀer in that the former is a light verb that can form complex predicates while the latter cannot.

Adding linearization to the pot

The theme of the ﬁrst section of the paper was that the data that Abeill´ and Godard (1994) present
e
were speaking to the issue of French periphrastic tenses being monoclausal, and that in LFG this is
an issue of grammatical relations structure (f-structure), not surface phrase structure (c-structure).
If we take Abeill´ and Godard (1994) to simply be arguing that French periphrastic tenses have a
e
ﬂat (i.e., monoclausal) grammatical relations structure, then I am in perfect agreement with them.
There is no argument. Similarly when A&G (p. 164) remark that they agree with the analysis that
“a sequence made of an aux + a participle + the complements has in a certain sense two heads:
a morpho-syntactic one (the aux) and a semantic one (the participle)”, then this analytic goal is
completely consonant with the motivations underlying Andrews and Manning (1993) and Andrews
(1996). The question, then, is whether A&G should be interpreted as talking about surface phrase
structure or about grammatical relations structure. Overtly, A&G seem to be talking about the
former. But it is worth noting that much recent HPSG work has been arguing for introducing an
Order Domain level that then reﬂects the surface phrase structure, while the traditional HPSG
daughters structure no longer need do so (Reape 1994, Pollard et al. 1993, Kathol 1995a, Kathol
and Pollard 1995, Gunji 1995). If this analytic approach is adopted, Manning (1995) argues that
the correct comparison between HPSG and LFG is to compare LFG c-structures with HPSG order
domains and LFG f-structures with HPSG ‘syntax’ (the dtrs and valence parts of the sign) –
14

essentially, because the c-structure and the order domain are the levels in each framework that
are required to reﬂect the observed word order and constituency constraints of the language being
analyzed, while the f-structure in LFG and the dtrs and valence features in HPSG indicate
syntactic depence and obliqueness at the level of grammatical relations. Thus I am in danger of
falling into the trap of arguing with a moving target – in particular note that Kim and Sag (1996)
make a couple of non-committal remarks (e.g., p. 33) that they might want to employ order domains
and linearization in their treatment of adverbs in English and French. It would be nice if the HPSG
position was clariﬁed in this respect.6 In the meantime, though, I will continue to assume that
A&G are writing about surface phrase structure, and the arguments of the preceding section then
still stand.

Conclusions

This paper has had a very limited aim: reassessing the ﬂat versus right-branching structure debate
in the light of Abeill´ and Godard (1994). I have not aimed to present an LFG analysis of Romance
e
auxiliaries and other complex predicate constructions; for that see Alsina (1993), Andrews and
Manning (1993) and Andrews (1996). However, I hope that I have established that a variety of
evidence does still suggest that French periphrastic tense constructions, and Romance complex
predicate constructions in general, do have a rightward-branching phrase structure, and that the
phenomenon of monoclausality that complex predicates exhibit can and should be given a more
abstract characterization than in terms of phrase structure.

Though, on the ground, the issue of whether to do linearization or not seems to have existed now for several
years with no sign of it going away any time soon.
