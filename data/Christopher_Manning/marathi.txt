Lexical Conceptual Structure and Marathi
Christopher Manning
Jackendoﬀ (1987, 1990) has brought up various problems with the current use of thematic
roles (Kiparsky, 1987; Bresnan & Kanerva, 1989 and references cited therein) and suggested a
diﬀerent way of thinking of thematic roles as structural conﬁgurations in his semantic Lexical
Conceptual Structures (LCSs). Conversely, Joshi (1989) has claimed that Jackendoﬀ’s LCSs alone
are insuﬃcient, and that an analysis of certain facts in Marathi additionally requires the existence
of a level of predicate-argument structure (PAS). Below we will mention a few of Jackendoﬀ’s
arguments against the current conception of thematic roles. We will then look at Joshi’s arguments
about the necessity of a level of PAS in addition to LCS and conclude that providing Jackendoﬀ’s
LCSs are integrated into a suitable syntactic theory, neither of her points are problematic to
Jackendoﬀ.1 From there we will go on to re-examine some of the facts of Marathi, and show that
certain facts that have merely been stipulated or left unanalyzed when using thematic roles, receive
a rather elegant treatment when described via a combination of their syntax and LCS.
To keep this paper to a squibbish length, we’re going to have to take a few things on trust.
Firstly, we’ll assume that Joshi’s (1989, 1990) syntactic analysis of Marathi is essentially correct.2
Secondly we’re going to assume a grammatical formalism that allows one to wed together LFG-ish
syntax with Jackendovian semantics (I do actually have such a thing: Andrews & Manning (forthcoming)). Lastly, I’m not going to detail here the Deﬁnitive Linking Theory, but we’ll see just
enough of it to make the arguments look plausible.
Problems with thematic roles. Jackendoﬀ raises several problems with conventional thematic
roles. He points out that many of the roles subcategorized by verbs have no categorization in the
standard thematic role lists. His usual argument is to provide unnamed locational arguments such
as:
(1) a. John jumped the gorge.
b. The plane circled the tower.
This is a problem for Kiparsky who tries to include various locational roles:
[ Source < Goal < Means < Theme < From < To < Via < Verb > > > > > > > ]
It is less of a problem for Bresnan et al. who use just one locational macro-role:
Ag > Ben > Recip(Go)/Exp > Inst > Th/Pt > Loc
However it is not hard to think of other non-locational arguments for which there is no good
categorization:
1

The situation is somewhat clearer with the publication of Jackendoﬀ (1990) than at the time that Joshi (1989)
was written, though the crucial innovation of the Action Tier appears in Jackendoﬀ (1987). Note in particular that
in Chapter 11, Jackendoﬀ (1990) recreates within his LCS something similar to, but interestingly diﬀerent from,
currently touted thematic hierarchies.
2
Due to dialect variation among Marathi speaking linguists, it can be rather hard to tell when someone is giving a
theory that better explains the same facts as against a theory that is explaining diﬀerent grammaticality judgements.

(2) John underwent an operation.
We all know the joke: ‘Who knows what that NP is—let’s call it a Theme.’ Also, thematic roles
should not be merely a theory of NPs: red is a Source and green a Goal in:
(3) The light changed from red to green.
An NP may hold multiple θ-roles in a sentence:
(4) a. John (Agent, Theme) is chasing Bill (Theme, Goal).
b. John (Agent, Source, Recipient) paid him (Source, Recipient) $5 for the book.
Whereas thematic roles were meant to be grounded in clear semantic intuitions, the chosen role in
such cases is usually just the one that ‘works’ in the syntax, and thematic roles are thus reduced
to a theory-internal artifact.
But even if we could ﬁnd a satisfactory set of thematic roles, there is a question of the need for
them. While some would wish no association with LCSs, for those such as Bature (1991) who use
both LCSs and PASs, there is a clear question of parsimony. Given that LCS is necessary anyway
as a semantic representation of sentences, aesthetic sense (perhaps as codiﬁed in Occam’s Razor)
would suggest that we should not additionally postulate a level of PAS unless it is really necessary.
Joshi’s arguments for Predicate Argument Structure. Conversely, Joshi raises two problems for a theory that uses only LCSs. Firstly she mentions the classic problem of diﬀerentiating
the roles between pairs of verbs such as buy/sell, or like/please for that matter. However, while
these pairs of verbs do have identical roles on the Thematic Tier, they can now be easily diﬀerentiated because of their diﬀerent classiﬁcation of arguments on the Action Tier. We would have
lexical entries such as the following for buy and sell respectively:3

The motivation for these structures and the further predictions are similar to those of Joshi’s (1989)
own analysis using PAS.
More seriously, Joshi raises the question of the binding of aapan. Joshi shows that a binder of
.
aapan in the same clause must be the logical subject of the clause. In particular, in a lexical causative
.
3

These diﬀer from those that Jackendoﬀ (1990) proposes: he inserts an extra CS function, but this seems to go
against both his own discussion on p. 128–129 and the behavior of these verbs when modiﬁed by an adverb like
almost. At any rate, either way they are diﬀerentiable.

2

aapan cannot be bound by the causee. She then contrasts lexical and periphrastic causatives (where
.
the causee can be the antecedent) and points out that both are biclausal at LCS (by assumption,
and as shown by tests using adverbs like almost). Hence she suggests that there is no way to
characterize the binder of aapan at LCS in a way that would distinguish these two cases. This
.
might be true if one is looking just at an LCS, but if we have pieces of LCS integrated with a
syntactic formalism, this is not true. Suppose for simplicity that aapan can be bound by a logical
.
subject in its own clause or any clause it is embedded in.4 We will illustrate the general eﬀect by
exhibiting a partial description of the grammatical functions and semantic arguments of a lexical
and a periphrastic causative, respectively:

[ “in self’s house” ]

This is obviously a gross oversimpliﬁcation, as not only can an aapan that is a direct argument not be bound
.
inside its own clause, but aapan has various logophoric properties as well. However, these complications don’t aﬀect
.
the force of Joshi’s argument.

3

Then the idea is this: we will specify most of the anaphoric binding path of aapan in the functional
.
projection (as in Dalrymple, 1990), but for the ﬁnal step, we will switch to the semantic projection
ˆ
and select the logical subject (we will copy the notation θ, but will mean by this the highest
argument in the LCS thematic hierarchy that Jackendoﬀ (1990) develops in Chapter 11). We could
then write this restriction as follows:
ˆ
↑σ =c (({XCOMP | COMP}∗ ↑)σ θ )
Moreover, if we return to the real aapan, it appears that the biclausal LCS will be part of the
.
key to describing its binding possibilities. Note the following contrast:5
(7) a. *Mini-ne aaplyaa-laa badavle
.
Mini-erg self-acc
hit
*‘Minii hit herselfi .’
b. Mini-ne Shaam-kadun aplyaa-laa have-t ucalavle
Mini-erg Shaam-oblag self-acc air-in lift-cause-past
‘Minii made Shaam lift selfi in the air.’
In both sentences aapan is a Patient and an OBJ, and in both sentences the desired antecedent is
.
an Agent and a SUBJ. As seen in (7a), when aapan is a direct argument of a verb, usually it cannot
.
be bound by the SUBJ of that same verb. However, with the lexical causative of a transitive verb,
it can be so bound. Intuitively, the diﬀerence is that the SUBJ is further away this time, because
of the biclausal LCS. We tentatively suggest the following constraint: If aapan is an argument (as
.
opposed to an adjunct) it cannot be bound by the potential logical subject immediately superior
to it, where by a potential logical subject we mean the highest role on the LCS hierarchy at one
level of LCS (it may not be a real logical subject because one LCS might be embedded in another).
This correctly predicts that in transitives and the causatives of intransitive verbs that an aapan in
.
the OBJ slot cannot refer to the SUBJ or Causer (as it is the immediately superior potential logical
subject), but that in the casuative of a transitive verb, aapan can refer anaphorically to the Causer,
.
because, even if not overtly expressed, the Causee is an intervening potential logical subject.
Capturing semantic intuitions with LCSs.
Pandharipande (1990) does not use complex
abstract syntactic analyses and so it might seem the work of a “ﬂat-earth functionalist” (Pullum,
1989), but lately this mindset has been receiving greater respect. Mohanan & Mohanan (1990)
admit that K. P. Mohanan “conclude[d] prematurely that the regularities between the dative case
and its meaning are at best a tendency, and that the distribution of the dative case. . . must be
stipulated on individual morphemes.” Scanning the references of Bresnan & Kanerva (1989) is also
instructive. So let us take seriously Pandharipande’s main intuition, that the dative -laa is a marker
of location or possession and that dative marked subjects should also be regarded as locationals.
In particular, she considers the following paradigm:
(8) a. nad¯ a p¯r yeto
ı-l¯
u
river-dat ﬂood comes
‘The river gets ﬂooded (The ﬂood comes to the river).’
b. m¯ g¯v¯-l¯
ı a a a
z¯to
a
I village-dat go
‘I go to the village.’
5

aaplyaa is a morphophonemic variant of aapan. Also note that, unfortunately, the transcription of examples in
.
this paper is not consistent, but I feared worse results if I had attempted to rectify this.

4

c. ma-l¯ r¯g yeto
a a
I-dat anger comes
‘I get angry (Anger comes to me).’
d. m¯ ty¯-l¯ pεse deto
ı a a
I he-dat money give
‘I give him money.’
e. ma-l¯ ek bh¯u ¯he
a
a¯ a
I-dat one brother is
‘I have a brother.’
f. ma-l¯ r¯g ¯he
a a
a
I-dat anger is
‘I am angry (I have anger).’
g. z¯d¯-l¯ phula ¯let
a.a a
a
tree-dat ﬂowers are
‘The tree has ﬂowers.’
h. phul¯-l¯ manda v¯s
a a
a
ahe
¯
ﬂower-dat mild fragrance is
‘The ﬂower has a mild fragrance.’
She suggests that all these dative NPs are a uniﬁed category covering location and possession.
Under Bresnan & Kanerva’s thematic role hierarchy, however, they would be distributed between
at least the Locative, Experiencer and Recipient thematic roles (and it’s not exactly clear what role
possessors have on this hierarchy: Joshi (1989) seems to tentatively suggest that Possessor is yet
another role that ranks between Agent and Theme). Pandharipande’s intuition has been entirely
lost. There is no explanation of the case marking, semantic relationship or similar syntactic behavior. But consider the thematic tier representation of these verbs that can be given in Jackendoﬀ’s
LCSs:
(9) a.

Event

GOspatial (ﬂood, [Path TO([Place River ]) ])

b.

Event

GOspatial (I, [Path TO([Place village ]) ])

c.

Event

GOident (anger, [Path TO([Place I ]) ])

d.

Event

GOposs (money,

FROM([Place I ])
Path

TO([Place he ])

)

e.

Event

BEposs (brother, [Path TO([Place I ]) ])

f.

Event

BEident (anger, [Path TO([Place I ]) ])

g.

Event

BEposs (ﬂowers, [Path TO([Place tree ]) ])

h.

Event

BEposs (fragrance, [Path TO([Place ﬂower ]) ])

The dative-marked arguments have regained their conceptual unity. They all appear as the Place
in the second argument of the conceptual functions BE and GO:
(10) [Path TO([Place

]) ]
5

As Jackendoﬀ (1983, 1990) has argued, postulating the conceptual functions BE and GO allows us
to explain the pervasive use of notions of motion in both real and metaphorical domains. BE and
GO generalize across conceptual domains, though we can index the function with the particular
domain being used (GOspatial , GOposs , etc.).
Of course, the whole reason why Experiencer is carefully placed above Theme in most thematic
hierarchies is to explain the more “logical-subject-like” properties of an Experiencer. But with the
addition of the Action Tier to Jackendoﬀ’s LCSs, properties can be factored between thematic and
‘action’ properties. Although Experiencers are clearly metaphorical locations in Indian languages,
they diﬀer from normal locations by being entities that react. This is expressed in Jackendoﬀ’s
system by their being the ﬁrst argument of the REACT function on the Action Tier. So the LCS
for the verbs in (8b–c) will look like the following:
(11) b.

AFF(—A ,
Event

c.

)

GOspatial (—, [Path TO([Place

]) ])

REACT(—A ,—A )
Event

GOident (—, [Path TO([Place — ]) ])

Thus in (8b) the village is merely a location, while in (8c), the speaker is both a location and an
entity that reacts to the arrival of anger.
Similarly, we will see the possessor in I have a brother as reacting to this event. It gets somewhat
more metaphorical with nonsentient beings, but for them also, we will view the diﬀerence between:
(12) a. The tinsel is on the tree.
b. The tree has ﬂowers.
as the tree in (a) being a simple location, but also appearing on the Action Tier in (b). Even
inanimate possessors become the logical subject in Marathi, as can be shown with the -un test
(only logical subjects can control -un participial clauses: Joshi, 1990):
(13) a. gharaalaa don darvaaje aahet
house-dat two doors-nom are
‘The house has two doors.’
b. vaadalaat dashaa hounahi gharaalaa adzun don darvaaje aahet.
.
‘In spite of [the house] being ruined in the storm, the house still has two doors.’
This linking of arguments to the ﬁrst argument of REACT on the action tier forces them to appear
higher on Jackendoﬀ’s thematic hierarchy, indeed, as the logical subject.
This recognition of experiencers as locations seems essential to an adequate analysis of Marathi.
We have already seen that -laa can mark either a vanilla location (8b) or an ‘experiencer subject’
(8c). But, in fact, it is not only -laa that has these properties.6 For example, consider another
locative suﬃx -t ‘in’:
(14) to ˇ¯le-t
sa.
gelaa
he school-in went
‘He went to school.’
6
I thank Smita Joshi for the data crucial to the explication of this point, and in general for assistance with other
questions.

6

It, also, can be used with inanimate qualities and human locations:
(15) tyaaˇyaa-t taakad aali
c
he-in
strength came
‘He became strong (He got strength).’
and in these sentences, just like the ‘Dative Subject’ construction, we ﬁnd that he, which is both
a Place and the ﬁrst argument of REACT on the Action Tier, becomes the logical subject, again
demonstrated by using the -un test:7
(16) jew-un
tyaaˇaa-t taakad aali
c
Upon dining he-in
strength came
‘Upon dining, he felt strong.’
If we acknowledge that this usage of ‘Experiencer Subjects’ is semantically determined but fail
to explicate the connection between ‘Experiencers’ and locations, then we are clearly missing a
generalization.
Yet another linking theory. Now that PAS has been abandoned, we need to explain how we
will link directly from LCS to grammatical functions (GFs).8 Jackendoﬀ (1990, Chapter 11) has
one stab at such a theory. However, it does not seem that his approach (of lining up a grammatical
and semantic hierarchy and then pairing them oﬀ) is completely suitable for handling the sort of
Reversal Constructions (Joshi, 1990) which are found in Marathi.9 We could just import LFG’s
Lexical Mapping Theory wholesale, but it seems a little unnatural. For although we have decided
that ‘Experiencers’ are a special type of Locative, we would have to say that while things that
are only Locatives are intrinsically [−o], things that are also linked to REACT on the Action Tier
don’t have this intrinsic feature, but instead are intrinsically [−r]. For if ‘Experiencers’ were also
intrinsically [−o], they would not be able to participate in Reversal Constructions.
These ideas are still a bit up in the air, and space is running out, but let me just brieﬂy outline
how another LCS linking theory might work. We’ll inherit the distinction between arguments and
adjuncts from Jackendoﬀ and I’m assuming knowledge of the facts in Joshi (1990). Let’s name
some LCS structural conﬁgurations we will use:
Actor:
Reacter:
Patient:

First argument of AFF
First argument of REACT
Second arg. of AFF− or REACT

Theme: First arg. of BE or GO
Locative: Second arg. of BE or GO
Beneﬁciary: Second argument of AFF+

The LCS thematic hierarchy will be:
7

I’m not an expert on RG, but these facts would also seem to be rather damaging to Rosen & Wali’s (1989)
analysis. The ﬁrst argument here must start oﬀ as an Initial-1 and then strangely demote into a locative non-term.
8
Marathi would seem quite problematic to Kiparsky’s (1987) Direct Linking Theory because arguments with
identical case, position and agreement possibilities can bear diﬀerent GFs. Whatever faults their article may have,
Rosen & Wali (1989) make this point quite strongly.
Also, Bature (1991) suggests that “A direct link between LC structure and grammatical functions predicts that
all lexical meanings of predicates are accessible to syntax.” But this is not necessarily the case. The marking of
argument positions (subscripted with an ‘A’ in Chapter 11 of Jackendoﬀ (1990)), limits what information the linking
theory is allowed to make use of. Besides, the logic is faulty. For next we could argue that because a direct link
between PAS and LCS predicts that all lexical meanings of predicates are capable of altering the ordering of the
thematic hierarchy, we should postulate another level between LCS and PAS. The inﬁnite regress that follows should
be obvious to the reader.
9
These are constructions where for two semantic arguments, either can appear as the surface SUBJ and the other
then appears as the surface OBJ.

7

Ag > Reacter > Pt/Th/Ben > Loc
Intransitive verbs make their one argument the SUBJ. Normal transitive verbs will have an Agent
and a Patient/Theme and link to a SUBJ and an OBJ in the obvious way. For ‘Experiencer Subject’
verbs, although the Reacter is the logical subject, let’s presume the Reacter and the Patient are
suﬃciently ‘near’ in ranking that either can be the SUBJ and the other is the OBJ. For ditransitives,
the Agent becomes the SUBJ and the other two arguments will be a Theme and a Beneﬁciary10 or
similar and they both become OBJs (one or other of which might be ‘restricted’). Transitive verbs
passivize by making the Actor unavailable to argument linking (linkable only as an adjunct). The
Patient, being the only grammatically linked argument will become the SUBJ. ‘Experiencer subject’
verbs don’t passivize, lacking an Actor, or causativize. When ditransitive verbs passivize, the Actor
is again restricted, and the remaining two arguments (Theme and Beneﬁciary) can again engage in
a Reversal Construction. In Marathi one can only have causatives of verbs with Patients, because
in Marathi, the Patient of AFF on the Action Tier of the causative morpheme must unify with a
Patient-like argument in the lower verb. Unergative verbs do not have morphological causatives. In
the main class of (monoclausal at f-structure, morphological) causative verbs, the (outer) Actor will
link to the SUBJ and the (only) Patient will link to the OBJ. If the base verb is transitive, the Causee
(inner Actor) will be left unlinked, but it can be introduced via an Adjunct rule that introduces
unlinked Actors, which in Marathi involves the suﬃx -kadun. The small class of ‘ingestive verbs’
.
(Joshi, 1990) form a Causative with two OBJs. The semantics of these verbs seems to suggest that
on the Action Tier these verbs are speciﬁed for both AFF and REACT. Here, normally the Patient
of the cause morpheme will unify with the Reacter (with most ingestive verbs this is mandatory,
but a very small number allow the Patient of the cause morpheme to unify with either the lower
Reacter or the lower Patient). The active form will thus have two Patients, and both become OBJs.
When such a verb is passivized, the Actor is restricted from grammatical linking and we will again
have a Reversal Construction: either of these Patients can become the SUBJ and the other becomes
the OBJ.
A Final Word.
It could be suggested that the reason that PAS is no longer needed is that
Jackendoﬀ (1990) has incorporated all the desirable aspects of PAS hierarchies into his LCS, and
there is some truth in that. Also, Bresnan & Kanerva suggest that the labels on their thematic
hierarchy are taken to be abstractions over the roles of a more ﬁne-grained semantic analysis, and
we have seen (above and Jackendoﬀ, Chapter 11), that we can indeed deﬁne such abstractions
over LCS structural positions. So there is maybe not that much to argue about. But the use of
LCS does give one a more expressive and less problematic vocabulary in which to state facts that
vary in their scope and degree of generality. With thematic roles, one is restricted to the single
level of generality decided by the person that wrote the thematic role hierarchy. More ﬁne-grained
semantic distinctions are uncapturable, while less ﬁne-grained generalizations can be described only
via stipulated ‘hyper-roles’.

10

The meaning of Jackendoﬀ’s Beneﬁciary is really much closer to LMT’s Recipient (sometimes also referred to as
Goal).
