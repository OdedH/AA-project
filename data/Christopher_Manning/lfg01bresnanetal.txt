ABSTRACT

The same categorical phenomena which are attributed to hard grammatical constraints
in some languages continue to show up as statistical preferences in other languages, motivating a grammatical model that can account for soft constraints.
The effects of a hierarchy of person (1st, 2nd 3rd) on grammar are categorical in
some languages, most famously in languages with inverse systems, but also in languages
with person restrictions on passivization. In Lummi, for example, the person of the subject
argument cannot be lower than the person of a nonsubject argument. If this would happen in the active, passivization is obligatory; if it would happen in the passive, the active
is obligatory (Jelinek and Demers 1983). These facts follow from the theory of harmonic
alignment in OT: constraints favoring the harmonic association of prominent person (1st,
2nd) with prominent syntactic function (subject) are hypothesized to be present as subhierarchies of the grammars of all languages, but to vary in their effects across languages
depending on their interactions with other constraints (Aissen 1999). There is a statistical
reﬂection of these hierarchies in English. The same disharmonic person/argument associations which are avoided categorically in languages like Lummi by making passives either
impossible or obligatory, are avoided in the SWITCHBOARD corpus of spoken English by
either depressing or elevating the frequency of passives relative to actives. The English
data can be grammatically analyzed within the stochastic OT framework (Boersma 1998,
Boersma and Hayes 2001) in a way which provides a principled and unifying explanation
for their relation to the crosslinguistic categorical person effects studied by Aissen (1999).
 

1 Categorical Effects of Person on Voice
The effects of the person hierarchy (1) on grammar are categorical in some languages, most
famously in languages with inverse systems, but also in languages with person restrictions
on passivization. In Lummi (Straits Salish, British Columbia), for example, the person of
the subject argument cannot be lower than the person of a nonsubject argument. If this
would happen in the active, passivization is obligatory; if it would happen in the passive,
the active is obligatory (Jelinek and Demers 1983, 1994).2

The same holds in other, unrelated languages such as the Tanoan language Picur´s (New
ı
Mexico) (Zaharlick 1982, Mithun 1999: 226–228) and the Southern Wakashan language
2

The ‘transitive’ stem sufﬁx -t, glossed TR, is one of a set that marks degree of volitionality of control
of the action; the passive sufﬁx - , glossed PASS, also marks middles (Jelinek and Demers 1994: 706). With
local person arguments the active is obligatory. The Lummi pattern holds for bound pronouns; full nominal
phrases designating speaker and hearer are formally 3rd person deictic expressions (Jelinek and Demers 1983:
173; 1994: 714).

Nootka (British Columbia) (Whistler 1985, Emanatian 1988). Although person-driven passives are sometimes viewed as inverses (cf. Klaiman 1991, Jacobs 1994, Forrest 1994, Jelinek and Demers 1983, 1994 on Salish), the syntactic contrasts in (3) have been drawn
between person-driven passives and the Algonquian-type inverse exempliﬁed by Plains
Cree (Dahlstrom 1984), from Mithun (1999: 222–228):
(3)

Passive:
Inverse:
intransitive
transitive
patient Subject
patient Object
oblique case marking on agent non-oblique agent
omissibility of indeﬁnite agent non-omissibility

On the basis of such contrasts, we accept with Mithun the evidence for the existence of
person-driven passives. (Mithun 1999: 227 concludes of Picur´s, “There is no question that
ı
these constructions are formally passive.”)

2 A Theory of Passivization in Optimality Theory
From a classical generative point of view, it is difﬁcult to see why person and voice should
interact: after all, the person of arguments has nothing to do with verbal lexical semantic
structure or case frames or the syntactic classiﬁcation of lexical argument roles in LFG ’s
lexical mapping theory (Bresnan 2001: ch. 14 and references), which have usually been
taken to drive passivization. But from a different perspective, such interactions are not
surprising.
It is well known that passives have properties of syntactically ‘marked’ constructions
(Greenberg 1966, Trask 1979):
(i) Typological distribution: There are many languages without passives.
(ii) Language-internal distribution: Where it occurs, the passive is often more restricted
than the active. For example, many languages restrict the passive agent (it may
not appear, or may appear only in certain persons); others have a morphologically
defective passive paradigm (lacking certain tenses, etc); only subclasses of active
transitive verbs may passivize.
(iii) Morphological marking: Passivization is morphologically marked (Haspelmath 1990).
But why should this be? An historical explanation is that actives are basic (unmarked)
verb types; passives arise from originally deverbal constructions such as stative adjectives
or nominals by a historical process of verbalisation (Trask 1979, Estival and Myhill 1988,

Haspelmath 1990, Garrett 1990). But the historical explanation does not answer the question: Why are actives the basic/unmarked verb types, rather than passives?
The intuition shared by many linguists and adopted by Aissen (1999) is that agents
make better subjects than patients do. Semantically ‘active’ (proto-agent) arguments harmonically align with the most prominent syntactic argument positions; semantically ‘inactive’ (proto-patient) arguments harmonically align with the least prominent syntactic positions. The ultimate reasons for this alignment lie in the pragmatics of discourse and the
cognitive biases of humans (see Giv´ n 1979, 1983, Kuno and Kaburaki 1977, Kuno 1987,
o
Ariel 1991, Warren and Gibson 2001, MacWhinney in progress for discussion of several
proposals).
The detailed effects of harmonic alignment on grammars can be explicitly modelled in
Optimality Theory (OT). In phonology, the sonority hierarchy aligns with syllable structure so that the most sonorous sounds are attracted to syllable peaks and the least sonorous
sounds to syllable margins (see Kager 1999 for a synthetic overview). Aissen (1999) proposes that syntax is analogous, with the most agentive semantic arguments attracted to the
structural ‘peak’ of the clause, the Subject, and the least agentive arguments to the nonSubjects. Harmonic alignment is formally deﬁned for a binary scale and an -ary scale
(Prince and Smolensky 1993: 136). The binary scale refers to a structure (of the syllable or clause, for example), and the -ary scale refers to a substantive dimension such as
sonority or proto-agentivity. Harmonic alignment produces two aligned Harmonic scales,
one showing how the elements of the -ary scale are distributed with respect to the high
element of the binary scale, the other showing how they are distributed with respect to the
low element.
Aissen’s (1999) theory of harmonic alignment in syntax is illustrated in (4).

The prominence scales on the left are analogous to the structural hierarchy of the syllable
and the sonority hierarchy, respectively.3 The upper and lower ends of these prominence
scales are harmonically aligned as shown in the middle. On the right these alignments are
expressed in OT terms as subhierarchies of markedness constraints preﬁxed with the ‘*’
(‘avoid’) operator and inverted so that the most disharmonic combinations will receive the
worst constraint violations.
3

Aissen (1999) assumes a binarized relational hierarchy, adopting the binary scale Subject Nonsubject,
which encapsulates both S O and S OBL. She also assumes a role hierarchy based on proto-role theory
(Dowty 1991, Asudeh 2001).

Other constraints may be interleaved in constraint subhierarchies, enhancing or suppressing their effects, but the relative ranking of the constraints in a subhierarchy is ﬁxed
across languages.4 Harmonic alignment of the person hierarchy (1) with the relational
hierarchy (see n. 3) yields further constraint subhierarchies, which may interact with the
harmonic alignments in (4):

The markedness of the passive compared to the active follows from the universal subhierarchy *S

passive is the optimal expression, all else being equal:

But if the active is the optimal expression of a semantically transitive input, how can
passivization occur at all? The answer is of course that other constraints favor the passive:
avoiding or ‘backgrounding’ the agent (Shibatani 1985, Thompson 1987), avoiding subjects newer than non-subjects in the discourse (Birner and Ward 1998), placing the topic in
subject position to enhance topic continuity (Giv´ n 1983, Thompson 1987, Beaver 2000),
o
etc. Tableau (7) illustrates this outcome for English, taking Birner and Ward’s theory that
passive subjects tend to be discourse-newer than non-subjects as the basis for the constraint

This analysis of Lummi differs somewhat from that given in Aissen (1999); it was derived from the
Lummi data by the Gradual Learning Algorithm. See below for further discussion.

Crosslinguistic variation comes from reranking (see Aissen 1999 for details). In languages without passives, the constraint *S is undominated by any of these countervailing
constraints. In general, the same constraints are hypothesized to be present in all grammars,
but are more or less active depending on their ranking relative to other constraints. Thus
with third person agent and patient:

We know this because the disharmonic combinations are still grammatical in English, unlike Lummi: She met me, She’ll be met by you.6

3 Statistical Person/Voice Interactions in English
In the OT framework of the present study, following Aissen (1999), the active and passive
are viewed as alternative candidate expressions of the same input person/role combinations. Evidence of person/voice interactions in English has been given previously (Svartvik
1966, Estival and Myhill 1988; Seoane Posse 2000, DeLancey 1981, Kuno and Kaburaki
1977, Kuno 1987, cf. Kato 1979, reviewed in Dingare 2001). But for the present study
what is needed is information about the systematic choices made rather than information
about the distributions of subsets within passives or actives. Prior studies generally fail to
provide the full joint distribution, from which we can reconstruct the conditional frequencies needed.7 We have therefore examined the parsed SWITCHBOARD corpus, a carefully
designed database of spontaneous telephone conversations spoken by over 500 American
English speakers, both male and female, from a great variety of speech communities (Godfrey et al. 1992, Marcus et al. 1993). The conversations average 6 minutes in length, collectively amounting to 3 million words of text. We have used the parsed portion of this
corpus, which contains 1 million words.
6

We note that Aissen’s (1999) constraint subhierarchy *O
*O , taken as a whole, penalizes transitivity and would therefore favor passives over actives if ranked high enough. We defer discussion of this
problem to future work.
7
Estival and Myhill (1988) provide exactly the kind of information needed for animacy and deﬁniteness,
but they provide person frequencies only for the patient role.

We have found that the same disharmonic person/argument associations which are
avoided categorically in languages like Lummi by making passives either impossible or
obligatory, are avoided in the SWITCHBOARD corpus of spoken English by either depressing or elevating the frequency of passives relative to actives. Compared to the rate of
passivization for inputs of third persons acting on third persons (1.2%), the rate of passivization for ﬁrst or second person acting on third is substantially depressed (0%) while
that for third acting on ﬁrst or second (2.9%) is substantially elevated:

The leftmost column in (11) gives the four types of inputs (local person acting on local,
local acting on nonlocal, etc.). We estimate the number of times each input was evaluated
as the number of actives plus passives with that person/structure association. We then
calculate the rate of passivization as the number of times that input was realized as passive.
Though the percentage of full passives (with by phrases) in spoken conversational English is very small, the person/voice effects are highly signiﬁcant ( = 115.8, p 0.001;
Fisher exact test, p 0.001). Similar signiﬁcance levels result if short passives are included, but we omit them because the person of the agent is not always clear. See Dingare
(2001) for further analysis and detailed methodological discussion.
In sum, the ‘hard’ grammatical constraints on person/voice interactions seen in languages like Lummi, Picur´s, and Nootka continue to show up as statistical preferences in
ı
English.

4 Why is English like Lummi?
It is “a mainstay of functional linguistics” that “linguistic elements and patterns that are
frequent in discourse become conventionalized in grammar” (from a publisher’s blurb on
Bybee and Hopper 2001). On this view, Lummi is simply at an extreme point from English
along the continuum of conventionalization that connects frequentistic preferences in usage
to categorical grammatical constraints. But as noted by Bresnan and Aissen (to appear), it
remains unclear in a conventional generative syntax by what mechanisms usage preferences
can harden into grammatical conventions:
Classical generative theories of formal grammar are designed with mathematically discrete and logically deterministic formal architectures. On these

theories, frequentistic processes (such as the conventionalization of usage
preferences) must belong either to grammar-external ‘performance’ along
with speech errors and memory limitations, or to external choices among
competing dialect grammars. Yet neither of these alternatives is an adequate
model of variation and change, as ﬁrst pointed out by Weinreich, Labov,
and Herzog (1968). The same is true of the variable effects of markedness
hierarchies on syntax.
— Bresnan and Aissen (to appear)
Stochastic Optimality Theory offers a useful approach to this phenomenon. It is one of a
family of new optimization-based theories of grammar that can provide a uniﬁed account
of categorical, variable, and gradient data (see Anttila in press, Manning to appear, and
references).

5 Stochastic Optimality Theory
Stochastic OT (Boersma 1998, 2000, Boersma and Hayes 2001) differs from standard OT
in two essential ways:
(i) ranking on a continuous scale: Constraints are not simply ranked on
a discrete ordinal scale; rather, they have a value on the continuous scale
of real numbers. Thus constraints not only dominate other constraints, but
they are speciﬁc distances apart, and these distances are relevant to what the
theory predicts.
(ii) stochastic evaluation: at each evaluation the real value of each constraint is perturbed by temporarily adding to its ranking value a random value
drawn from a normal distribution. For example, a constraint with the mean
rank of 99 could be evaluated at 98.12 or 100.3. It is the constraint ranking
that results from these sampled values that is used in evaluation; it is referred
to as the ‘effective rank’ here.
Figure 1 shows two constraints,
and . Note that the scale is inverted to match the
standard OT convention that leftward is stronger in the constraint ranking. The ranks of
these constraints are the means of their varying effective rankings, and are marked at the
peaks of the bell curves; thus normally,
. Nevertheless, on some evaluations the
effective rank of
will fall in the lower end of its normal distribution at the same time that
the effective rank of
falls in the higher end of its distribution, and a ranking reversal will
. If
and
crucially conﬂict, such ranking reversals will create an
occur, with
alternative output for the same input, giving rise to variation.

An OT grammar with stochastic evaluation can generate both categorical and variable
outputs and can be learned from variable data by the GLA (Gradual Learning Algorithm,
Boersma 1998, Boersma and Hayes 2001). Categorical outputs arise when crucially ranked
constraints are distant. As the distance between constraints increases, interactions become
vanishingly rare.8 Variable outputs arise when crucially ranked constraints are closer together.
We can illustrate these ideas with the English ‘pragmatic passive’ grammar in Figure 2.
The ranking values of the constraints (= the means of their normal distributions) are given
on the axis. The constraint *S penalizes passives, but it is close enough to the constraint
*S
to allow discernable variation. When ranking reversal occurs, as shown in the
tableaux of (12), an alternative output occurs.

A distance of ﬁve standard deviations gives an expected reversal rate of less than 0.02% (Boersma and
Hayes 2001: 50). Units of measurement are arbitrary. The standard deviation of ranking variation here is
ﬁxed at 2.0, so a ranking distance of 10 units between constraints is taken to be effectively categorical.

In this stochastic grammar pragmatic or discourse-driven passivization is a statistical tendency, but not a categorical property of the output. Passives avoid subjects newer than
non-subjects, but passivization is infrequent, and actives with new subjects also occur.
Where do the real number ranking values in a stochastic grammar come from? Starting
from an initial state grammar in which all constraints have the same ranking values (arbitrarily set to be 100.0), the GLA is presented with learning data consisting of input-output
pairs having the statistical distribution of, say, English. For each learning datum (a given
input-output pair), the GLA compares the output of its own grammar for the same input;
if its own output differs from the given output, it adjusts its grammar by moving all the
constraints that disfavor its own output upward on the continuous ranking scale by a small
increment, in order to make them apply more strictly, and moving all constraints that disfavor the given output downward along the scale by a small decrement, to relax their effects. 9
The adjustment process applies recursively to constraint subhierachies in order to preserve
their local ordering relations.

The increment/decrement value is called the ‘plasticity’ and may be assumed to vary stochastically and
to change with age (Boersma 2000).

The constraint rankings and output distribution of this grammar were determined by simulation using the Praat system (Boersma and Weenink 2000), which includes an implementation of the Gradual Learning Algorithm.10 Because of the stochastic components,
the learned rankings and output distributions of grammars learned from the same distribution vary. The ﬁgures given are based on only one learned grammar; averaging over many
grammars would better guarantee representativeness.
The constraints used are Aissen’s (1999) constraint subhierarchies derived by harmonic
alignment as outlined above. However, the grammar unrealistically omits the effects of
the *S
constraint, which has a major inﬂuence on passivization in English (Birner and
Ward 1998). Additionally, ﬁve of these constraints which are less active in our data were
also omitted from the simulations for perspicuity: *Obl , *Obl , *O , and *O .
Observe that although the passive avoidance constraint *S dominates the personavoidance constraint *S , the two constraints are only 6 units apart (less than the nearcategorical distance of 10; see n. 8), and will therefore produce low frequency variable
outputs for some inputs. For inputs where only the agent is third person, passive outputs
will occasionally be favored by *S , as shown in the tableau in (14):

For learning the constraint rankings, a distribution of input-output pairs of person/voice combinations
was speciﬁed according to the proportions given in our data in (11). The GLA learned directly from these
distributions using the default settings in the Praat system for plasticity and replications. The relative ranking
of constraints (the means) in the subhierarchies was maintained.

When both agent and patient are third person, the *S constraint cannot decide between
active and passive, and the decision passes to other constraints. 11
The highest ranked constraint in Figure 3 is *Obl , which penalizes local person passive agents. It is more than 10 units (see n. 8) above any constraint that would disfavor an
active (namely, *O for an input with local-person patient and *O for an input with thirdperson patient). These rankings reﬂect the zero frequency of local person passive agents
in our data. Local person passive agents have been described as unacceptable in English
(Kuno and Kaburaki 1977). Though they may be dispreferred or contextually marked, they
are grammatical in spoken English. Among the examples cited by Kato (1979) are those in
(15):

b. When somebody says to me, “You’re great, how come you’re just a waitress?”
Just a waitress. I’d say, “Why, don’t you think you deserve to be served by
me?” (Studs Terkel, Working)
With more training data and a more complete constraint set which includes factors of topicality and focus, our model should learn grammars that produce passives with local person
agents. Note that if the ranking value of *Obl in the grammar of Figure 3 were lowered
from 109 to 104, the output of local person passives would increase to one-tenth of one
percent, 0.1%, while barely changing the frequency of other outputs.
In sum, stochastic OT can capture the soft inﬂuence of person on English passivization
that exists beneath the level of grammaticality judgments. Disharmonic person/argument
combinations are grammatical but avoided, affecting the frequency of passivization.
Unfortunately we lack a parsed SWITCHBOARD corpus for Lummi. Nevertheless, it is
possible to show by simulation how the descriptions of passive/voice interactions in Lummi
grammar can also be captured by a stochastic OT grammar. We interpret the descriptions
of Lummi from Jelinek and Demers (1983, 1994) by means of a simple distribution. Where
a sentence type is described as ungrammatical, we assign it 0% relative frequency; where
it is described as obligatory, we assign it 100%; and where it is described as optional, we
assign it 50%:

For this input it will be *S that permits passive ouputs, with slightly less frequency than the passive
outputs produced by *S , which is ranked marginally higher. In a less limited grammar other constraints
would ﬁll this role.

The simulated input/output distribution in (16) is then used to generate training data for
the GLA, as before. The initial state of the grammar and the training regime (n. 10) are
exactly the same as for English. A partial Lummi grammar learned by the GLA is shown
in Figure 4.

Note that in contrast to the English grammar in Figure 3, the syntactic person-avoidance
constraint *S in the Lummi grammar is more than 10 units (5 standard deviations) above
*S . This ranking yields the obligatory passivization of inputs with local person patients
and non-local person agents, capturing the categorical inﬂuence of person on Lummi passivization. The output distribution of the grammar in Figure 4 matches that in (16).
It might be thought that ranking on the continuous scale of real numbers is powerful
enough to learn any distribution. In fact, under the present theory there are no stochastic
OT grammars for ‘anti-Lummi’ or ‘anti-English’ distributions, which reverse the generalizations embodied in our data. Greater relative frequency of passives for ﬁrst or second
person acting on third would imply that third person subjects are avoided less than ﬁrst
or second person subjects. If so, then *S must dominate *S for a greater proportion
of evaluations. But that ranking violates the subhierarchy in (5), which in stochastic OT
requires the mean ranking values of these constraints to occur in the reverse order.
Thus, stochastic OT grammars are limited to subspaces of distributions that conform to
the theory embodied in the constraint set. They are not general-purpose statistical analyzers

and they have no special memory for frequencies (Boersma 2000).

7 Conventionalization and Frequency
Stochastic OT grammars allow us to place the person/voice interactions in English and
Lummi at points on a continuum of conventionalization that connects frequentistic preferences in usage to categorical grammatical constraints. If this general perspective is correct,
then we would expect to ﬁnd languages at intermediate points on this same continuum. In
the domain of person/voice interactions, Squamish (Coast Salish, British Columbia) may
be a case in point.
Squamish and Lummi differ in their treatment of ﬁrst person patient and nonlocal agent
combinations: passivization is obligatory in Lummi but optional in Squamish; with second person patients passivization is obligatory for both languages. Within the ordinal OT
framework, Aissen (1999) analyzes the difference between Lummi and Squamish by this
constraint ranking:

. . . *O
. . . *S

Given independent evidence that languages differ in whether ﬁrst or second person is dominant (DeLancey 1981), Aissen assumes that the mutual ranking of the local-person avoidance constraints is not ﬁxed by the subhierarchy, but subject to crosslinguistic variation.
However, it is not fully informative to say, as Aissen (1999) does, that passivization
with third person agents and ﬁrst person patients is optional in Squamish. In terms of what
is preferred rather than what is merely possible, Squamish is described as being much the
same as Lummi, “except that third person acting on ﬁrst may be active, though commonly
passive” (Klokeid 1969: 11). Thus in Squamish as in English, passives of the type I was
fooled by her are optional alternatives to actives with disharmonic local-person objects:
She fooled me. But in spoken English, as we have seen, such passives are exceedingly
infrequent, far less common than the corresponding actives, while in Squamish they are
more frequent than the corresponding actives.
In stochastic OT the rerankings postulated by Aissen (1999) take place on a continuous
scale and imply changes in frequency as well as changes in grammaticality. The high rate
of passivization with ﬁrst person patients in Squamish shows that a constraint favoring
passive, such as *O is still ranked considerably above a constraint favoring active, such as
*S , on our continuous constraint ranking scale. Squamish and Lummi are closely related
Coast Salish languages. It is plausible that we are observing a change in progress: the two
languages represent different points in the changing categoricity of person effects on the
passive, reﬂected in the ranking of the person-avoidance constraints for ﬁrst and second
person.

If a process of historical change is modeled by the movement in strength of a constraint
along the continuous scale, as implied by the stochastic OT model, then (all else being
equal) smooth changes in the relative frequencies of usage are predicted. Note however
that although the change is smooth, it is not predicted to be linear. Rather, if a constraint
reranking is crucial to the choice between two outputs, the prediction is that we should see
an ‘S’ curve between the proportion of occurrences of the two outputs, of the sort that has
been widely remarked on in historical and socio-linguistics (Weinreich, Labov, and Herzog
1968, Bailey 1973, Kroch 2001).

Difference in base constraint ranking

More technically, assuming that the difference in ranking of two constraints which are
crucial to the choice between two outputs A and B is changing linearly, then the proportion
of output A is given by a logistic curve (Figure 5): when the constraints are at least 5
standard deviations apart, the proportion of the disfavored output is negligible; at 2 standard
deviations, the rate reaches about 8%, but then it increases much more rapidly to 50% of
each output when the two constraints are equally ranked.
These considerations suggest that classical grammatical descriptions in terms of what
is ‘possible’ or ‘grammatical’ are overly idealized, concealing grammatically signiﬁcant
statistical structure beneath the idealization of linguistic intuitions of grammaticality.

8 Conclusion
The same categorical phenomena which are attributed to hard grammatical constraints in
some languages continue to show up as statistical preferences in other languages, motivating a grammatical model that can account for soft constraints.
This observation is not new. Giv´ n (1979: 26–31) already made this point forcefully
o
over twenty years ago. What is new here is our demonstration that the stochastic OT framework can provide an explicit and unifying theoretical framework for these phenomena in
syntax.
