Abstract
Phrase re-ordering is a well-known obstacle
to robust machine translation for language
pairs with signiÔ¨Åcantly different word orderings. For Arabic-English, two languages that
usually differ in the ordering of subject and
verb, the subject and its modiÔ¨Åers must be
accurately moved to produce a grammatical
translation. This operation requires more than
base phrase chunking and often deÔ¨Åes current
phrase-based statistical decoders. We present
a conditional random Ô¨Åeld sequence classiÔ¨Åer that detects the full scope of Arabic noun
phrase subjects in verb-initial clauses at the
FŒ≤=1 61.3% level, a 5.0% absolute improvement over a statistical parser baseline. We
suggest methods for integrating the classiÔ¨Åer
output with a statistical decoder and present
preliminary machine translation results.

‚Ä¢ the length of the NP subject approaches the
maximum phrase length used in translation
models1
‚Ä¢ the required horizontal movement nears the distortion limit commonly used in phrase-based
decoders
‚Ä¢ each recursive level in the NP is grammatical
The last condition causes the language model to
license different hypotheses that are grammatical but
semantically inconsistent with the source language
(e.g., Followers waited for all of the Christian and
Islamic sects). This is not a rare example. If we take
the Penn Arabic Treebank (ATB) (Maamouri et al.,
2004) as a guide, then over 25% of the NP subjects
in Arabic verb-initial clauses are of length Ô¨Åve or
greater (Table 1).

Introduction

Arabic to English translation often requires multiple, signiÔ¨Åcant phrase re-orderings. In particular,
the verb-initial clauses that are a characteristic
feature of Arabic must be inverted for SubjectVerb-Object (SVO) target languages like English.
To demonstrate the strain this requirement places
on phrase-based statistical decoders, consider the
VOS Arabic example in Figure 1. The noun phrase
(NP) subject is the recursive Arabic annexation
structure
iDafa in which the rightmost
noun is modiÔ¨Åed by a chain of nouns and adjectives.
The decoder must accurately identify the full NP
subject and move it four positions to the left under
the following conditions:

Figure 1: A VOS sentence from the ATB. The Arabic phrases read right-to-left, but we have ordered
the sentence from left-to-right in order to clearly illustrate the re-ordering problem.
Until the feature-poor statistical MT models currently in use are improved (Avramidis and Koehn,
2008), distortion limits will be necessary to both
make decoding tractable (Knight, 1999) and to improve translation quality. However, if the scope of
Arabic NP subjects could be accurately identiÔ¨Åed,

Our best Arabic-English system uses a maximum phrase
length of 5 and a distortion limit of 4.

then a component could be added to MT systems to
encourage particular re-orderings that would be otherwise unlikely under the conditions shown in Figure 1.
We present a conditional random Ô¨Åeld (CRF) sequence classiÔ¨Åer that detects the full scope of NP
subjects in verb-initial Arabic clauses. The assignment of grammatical relations to sentences has traditionally required a parser, although the popular Arabic parsers of Bikel (2004) and Klein and Manning
(2002) do not support grammatical relations by default. Not only does our classiÔ¨Åer greatly exceed the
performance of these two statistical parsers, but it
also processes MT test sets in seconds. The best
feature set Ô¨Ånds subjects at the FŒ≤=1 61.3% level,
a 5.0% absolute improvement over the best parser
baseline. We analyze current classiÔ¨Åer results, suggest strategies for integrating the classiÔ¨Åer output
with a phrase-based decoder, and provide a preliminary MT evaluation.

Background
Linguistic Motivation

Schmid and Rooth (2001) operationalize the syntactic notion of governance for the detection of grammatical relations. We extend this idea to Arabic
by capitalizing on its relatively rich set of syntactic dependency relations (Ryding, 2005). In addition to governance‚Äîwhich is the phenomenon in
which certain words cause dependents to inÔ¨Çect in
speciÔ¨Åc ways‚Äîwe are also concerned with concord
and agreement. Concord refers to matching between
nouns and dependents (e.g., adjectives) for features
such as deÔ¨Åniteness and case. When compatibility

Figure 2: Example of Arabic dependency relations.
The verb (1) is in agreement with the noun (2) in
both gender and number. The concord dependency
requires the adjective (3) to have a feminine afÔ¨Åx to
match the gender of the noun. Finally, the preposition (4) governs its noun (5), causing it to inÔ¨Çect in
the genitive case.
between verbs and subjects is in question, however,
agreement may be checked for other features such
as gender and number (Figure 2). In Arabic, agreement may be either rich (matching for gender and
number) or poor (in which only gender matches).
A Ô¨Ånal syntactic feature of Arabic related to these
dependencies is case. Case is explicitly marked in
Arabic, typically by a short vowel sufÔ¨Åx. ModiÔ¨Åcation to a long vowel sufÔ¨Åx can also indicate case.
There are three cases in Arabic: nominative (which
almost always indicates a subject, especially in verbinitial conÔ¨Ågurations), accusative, and genitive.
Along with these surface features, a particular account of syntactic movement in the deep structure
also inÔ¨Çuences our approach. Fassi Fehri (1993) argues in favor of the SVO X-bar schema in Figure 3
as the canonical phrase structure instantiated by the
Arabic grammar. If this is so, then a transformation
rule is required to explain the movement of the V
node (the verb) to the I position (ahead of the NP
subject) at the surface.2 Fassi Fehri (1993) claims
that poor agreement, which prevents the NP subject
from raising to I, is precisely that rule. Because the
verb ‚Äúprotects‚Äù the subject from other governors, V
to I raising also enables nominative declension of the
NP subject. This theory appears to account for the
admissibility of other case markings for SVO subjects, while VSO and VOS subjects are always nominative.

Discussions of word ordering have been the source of considerable controversy among Arabic grammarians. We neither
posit a novel claim nor take a deÔ¨Ånite side, but simply describe
one theory that has helped us understand the task.

Fassi Fehri (1993).
From this description, a method for detecting subjects seems obvious: why not develop a set of rules
to match NPs in the nominative case? Here convention subverts our project. The Arabic MT data
that we use is usually unvocalized: the short vowels and other diacritics, including case markings, are
dropped.3 From this perspective, the task of subject
detection in verb-initial Arabic clauses is better formulated as an attempt to recover information omitted by convention.
Anecdotal evidence suggests that this is a viable
objective. When case is not explicitly marked, as
is common in spoken Arabic, native speakers often
choose SVO and rich agreement to reduce ambiguity. In written Arabic, however, there is a stylistic
bias toward VSO without case markings. Consequently, writers often choose ‚Äúpragmatically-neutral
contexts‚Äù, or structures that require comparatively
little in terms of interpretive capacity. Our work
thus turns on the hypothesis that in MT data, other
surface‚Äìlevel dependency relations in the unvocalized text are sufÔ¨Åcient to identify subjects.
2.2

Conditional Random Fields

We use a conditional random Ô¨Åeld (CRF) sequence
model (Lafferty et al., 2001) for two reasons. First,
CRF classiÔ¨Åers have a relatively high modeling capacity and can thus accommodate the high number of overlapping features that we want to encode.
In our task, CRFs also provide a more convenient
method for specifying relationships between words
than do parsers. In canonical form, linear-chain
CRFs are deÔ¨Åned as a globally normalized product
of real-valued state functions s and transition functions t, where x is the sequence of observations and
y is the set of labels for those observations:
3

Automatic vocalization tools do exist, but we have not experimented with them.

We then Ô¨Ånd the assignment of labels to observations that maximizes the probability of the sequence (where Z(x) is an appropriate normalizing
constant):
p(y|x, Œª) =

1
Z(x)

t(yi , yi‚àí1 , xi )s(yi , xi )

(3)

CRFs can generalize to higher-order cliques, a capability that we leverage. Wallach (2004) discusses
this and other aspects of CRFs in greater detail.

Design

3.1

Data Annotation

We treat subject detection as a supervised learning
task. For training data, we use the Ô¨Årst three parts
of the ATB.4 Subjects in the ATB are labeled using
the ‚Äúdashtags‚Äù in Table 2 (Maamouri et al., 2009).
We relate these tag names to the previous linguistic
discussion by identifying Ô¨Åve categories of subjects
present in the data.
Subject inside VP This category accounts for
both VSO and VOS conÔ¨Ågurations, the subjects of
which are marked by NP-SBJ. We mark all non-trace
NP-SBJ spans in the classiÔ¨Åer training data. Since
these subjects require re-ordering during translation
to English, we tailor our feature set to them.
Null Subjects Null subjects are one of the most
vexing issues for Arabic-English MT. They result
from pro-drop clauses in which there is no lexical
subject. Instead, inÔ¨Çection on the verb indicates the
gender, number, and person of the dropped pronominal subject. In this case, the direct object often appears adjacent to the verb and we do not want to perform re-ordering. The ATB marks null subjects with
an NP-SBJ trace inside the VP, but this data is obviously not present in MT input. The CRF classiÔ¨Åer
does not explicitly indicate null subjects. Instead, it

is designed to avoid marking a subject in such scenarios.
Topicalized Subjects Pre-verbal subjects (SVO)
are marked with NP-TPC. In the presence of a topicalized subject, an NP-SBJ trace is always included
inside the sister VP (Maamouri et al., 2009). These
clauses do not require re-ordering, so we do not
mark them during training. We also remove the NPSBJ trace during pre-processing.
Clausal Subjects Certain Arabic words such as
the pseudo-verbs (
) take clausal subjects, which are marked with S-NOM-SBJ, SBARNOM-SBJ, or SBAR-SBJ. An example from the
ATB illustrates how we should handle clausal subjects:

Figure 4: NP-SBJ requires re-ordering around the
verb, while SBAR-SBJ should not be re-ordered. As
in Figure 1, the Arabic phrases read right-to-left, but
the sentence is arranged left-to-right.
Clearly the span covered by SBAR-SBJ is not reordered in the translation. Instead, we want to swap
the NP subject more than a thousand professors with
the verb retire. We thus do not mark clausal subjects
in training, focusing instead on NP subjects inside
clausal subjects.
Verbs of being/becoming (
) Verbs
of being and becoming merit special attention in
Arabic. In equational sentences (nominal sentences
in traditional Arabic grammars), they are omitted,
thus resulting in an SVO conÔ¨Åguration without
an explicit verb. In the verb-initial case, the NP
subject usually appears immediately after the verb,
but inversion of the subject and an NP predicate
is possible. Moreover, the NP subject is often
pro-drop, so it is not explicit. As before, we include
the NP-SBJ constituents in training, but we must
carefully design features to handle the pro-drop and
inverted cases.
To prepare the classiÔ¨Åer training data, we use

in training.

Tregex expressions to identify NP-SBJ constituents
in verb-initial clauses (Levy and Andrew, 2006). Using the Bies mappings provided with the ATB, we
convert the pre-terminal morphological analyses to
shortened part-of-speech (POS) tags. We augment
shortened tags for deÔ¨Ånite nouns with ‚ÄúDT‚Äù, which
improves performance. We then linearize the parse
trees and label each word according to the classes
in Table 3. A reserved symbol separates sentences.
Finally, delimiters are attached to the beginning and
end of each word so that initial, medial, and Ô¨Ånal
character n-grams may be identiÔ¨Åed.
3.2

Morphological Information

In addition to the POS tags and words, we add
morphological data to the classiÔ¨Åer input. We run
MADA 2.12, a morphological pipeline, on each input sentence (Habash and Rambow, 2005). MADA
Ô¨Årst uses a morphological analyzer to generate an nbest list of analyses for each word. It then re-ranks
the n-best lists using a weighted set of support vector
machine (SVM) classiÔ¨Åers. We use the stock classiÔ¨Åer set‚Äîwhich includes number and person‚Äîplus
the gender classiÔ¨Åer, which we give a 0.02 weight.
For verbs, we also retrieve the verb stem. Two sets
of data result from this procedure: the output of the
classiÔ¨Åers, and the top-ranked morphological analyses. We take the verb stem from the morphological
analyses and all other features from the SVM output. Including the words and POS tags, we have an
observation set x = x1 , x2 , x3 , ... , where each observation xi is a tuple consisting of (word, POS tag,
gender, number, person, case, verb stem).

Labels

The classiÔ¨Åer assigns one of seven different labels
from the set y to each token (Table 3). The label
set is derived primarily from observations about the
sequence model. First, we note that all subjects are
NPs, but not all NPs are subjects. We therefore deÔ¨Åne speciÔ¨Åc subject labels, and conÔ¨Åne all other NPs
to a single negative class. The START, IN, and END
subject labels help the model learn strong higherorder clique potentials (i.e., the model learns that IN
follows START, END follows IN, and so on). We
add a singleton subject type for single-word subjects. This is particularly effective for pronominal
subjects. To these subject labels we add a VERB
class so that the model learns that VERB usually
precedes START. Finally, we assign all other constituents to an OTHER category.

ClassiÔ¨Åer Features

Table 4 lists the CRF feature set. Space limitations
prevent expanded commentary, but we provide brief
feature descriptions. The strongest features, as indicated by the feature values learned during training,
are pos-tags, pp-vb-pairs, temporal-nn, inna, and
path. Experiments on the development set led to the
Ô¨Ånal model, which uses features 2 and 7-19. This
model is remarkable in that it does not use word, a
customary feature in classical sequence model tasks
like named entity recognition. For subject detection,
we found that word creates signiÔ¨Åcant overÔ¨Åtting. It
is also worth mentioning that BAMA 2.0, the morphological analyzer used by MADA, can emit nominative case markings. Given the preceding linguistic
discussion, we expected noise in this data. Experiments conÔ¨Årmed this intuition, so the Ô¨Ånal model
does not use nom-case.

Subject classiÔ¨Åer features and descrip-

We choose features that bias the classiÔ¨Åer toward
high precision. This decision is motivated by experience with integrating other syntactic MT features
into phrase-based decoders. As a general rule, if
a classiÔ¨Åcation decision cannot be made with high
conÔ¨Ådence, then it is best to abstain from inÔ¨Çuencing decoding.

Evaluation

Subject Detection

We implement the CRF classiÔ¨Åer using the publicly
available package of Finkel et al. (2005) and modify the Arabic parsers of both Klein and Manning
(2002) and Bikel (2004) to train on trees marked
with subject-inside-VP constituents. We divide the
ATB into training, development, and test sets using
the split of Chiang et al. (2006).5 To make the comparison fair, we use this split along with common
orthographic normalization rules for both the classiÔ¨Åer and parser experiments. We pre-tag the test set

The original split contained the duplicate document
ANN20021115.0092, which has been removed from the ATB.

for Bikel (2004) using the POS tagger of Toutanova
et al. (2003), a practice that slightly enhances performance.6
The classiÔ¨Åer training set is linearized and labeled
according to the conventions described previously.
We run MADA and the POS tagger of Toutanova et
al. (2003) on the classiÔ¨Åer test set instead of including the gold morphological analyses and POS tags
from the ATB. This procedure replicates the MT test
environment.
Table 5 lists results for both the parsers and two
CRF models. We score precision, recall, and FŒ≤=1
for contiguous subjects, i.e., credit for a classiÔ¨Åcation is only awarded for identiÔ¨Åcation of the full
NP subject scope. Although the classiÔ¨Åer is designed to identify subjects, it indirectly indicates
verb-initial sentences by the absence of a labeled NP
subject prior to the Ô¨Årst verb in the sentence. In the
same manner, it identiÔ¨Åes equational sentences by
omitting an NP subject label. Using these metrics,
the best feature set Ô¨Ånds verb-initial sentences with
98.1% accuracy.
4.2

Machine Translation

Our MT system uses a re-implementation of the
Moses decoder (Koehn et al., 2007) with the
same standard features: four translation features
(phrase-based translation probabilities and lexicallyweighted probabilities), word penalty, phrase
penalty, linear distortion, and language model score.
The training set consists of 19.5M English words
and 18.7M Arabic words originating from parallel
news data released by the LDC. We create word
alignments using the Berkeley Aligner (Liang et al.,
2006) and perform symmetrization with the growdiag heuristic.
We build a 5-gram language model from the
Xinhua and AFP sections of the Gigaword corpus
(LDC2007T40), in addition to the target side of the
training data. We manually remove Gigaword documents that were released during periods that overlapped with the development and test sets. The language model is smoothed with the modiÔ¨Åed KneserNey algorithm, retaining only trigrams, 4-grams,
and 5-grams that occurred two, three, and three
6

When trained and tested on the same ATB split, the POS
tagger achieves 96.4% accuracy.

times, respectively, in the training data.
The output of the CRF classiÔ¨Åer is incorporated
into the decoder using a simple model. We positively weight phrase pairs that fully overlap with the
subject and penalize partial overlaps with a score inversely proportional to the size of the overlap. The
feature therefore prefers hypotheses in which the
subject is translated as a contiguous block. Hypotheses that split the subject‚Äîby inserting a verb inside
the subject, for example‚Äîreceive a negative score.
A single feature weight for this model is set during
MERT (Och, 2003). Table 6 shows results using this
feature design.

Discussion

We have shown a considerable improvement in subject detection performance and, for completeness,
have presented preliminary MT results. In this section, we analyze current sources of error and identify
areas for improvement.
Subject/Object Boundary and PP Attachment
We have speciÔ¨Åed a set of strong features that indicate the beginning of a subject, but have yet to discover a robust way to Ô¨Ånd the last word in a subject.
‚ÄúCatastrophic‚Äù chains of false positives can thus occur. In these scenarios, the classiÔ¨Åer properly detects
the beginning of a subject, but fails to identify its
other boundary. It classiÔ¨Åes every word as a subject
until it encounters the sentence delimiter.

Figure 5: An example of the PP attachment problem. The classiÔ¨Åer does not correctly identify the NP
subject Ô¨Ånal boundary and thus includes the second
of the two adjacent PPs in the subject.
Prepositional phrase (PP) attachment, a common
problem in parsing, creates ambiguity at subject
boundaries (Figure 5). The path feature does help
in this regard, but it is not a comprehensive solution.
‚ÄúRecursive‚Äù NP subjects Our experiments mark
NP subjects that are not contained in other NP subjects (so-called maximal subjects). A non-trivial
number of instances in the ATB contain NP subjects
with internal NP subjects. This phenomenon is also
present in English, as shown by this example:
Whether Peter is guilty and which people helped him
are the issues.

Both Peter and people are the subjects of their
respective clauses, while both are part of the main
clause NP subject. Given that the accuracy of the
classiÔ¨Åer degrades with subject length, performance
could be improved by only labeling NP subjects up
to a given length (e.g., the phrase-limit used in a
translation model). In this example, it is likely that
the classiÔ¨Åer could detect the two smaller clausal
subjects, but would not identify the full scope of the
main clause subject. In some MT settings, this may
be a preferable strategy.
Machine Translation We have not yet obtained
substantial gains in MT performance, but our initial experiments have revealed promising directions
for future work. The key difference in experimental parameters between BASELINE and BASE LINE +SUBJ is the distortion limit (recall that this

parameter governs horizontal movement by words
and phrases). When testing the subject feature, we
initially set the linear distortion to four, above which
performance degrades in our baseline system. We
noticed a decrease in performance across all test
sets: the feature had a negative effect relative to the
baseline. We then set the distortion limit to Ô¨Åve and
ran MERT again. This time, the subject feature received a relatively high weight and performance was
competitive with the baseline. These experiments
suggest that even a simple realization of the feature
does have useful discriminative capacity in that it
encourages principled re-orderings as the distortion
limit increases. We speculate that more substantial
improvements could be realized with a feature design that utilizes word alignments. This investigation is left to future work.

Prior Work

Two groups of literature that are immediately relevant to our work investigate the assignment of grammatical relations to English text. The Ô¨Årst group
employs supervised and unsupervised learning techniques during parsing. Carroll and Briscoe (2002),
who use a semi-lexicalized LR parser augmented
with the governor annotation algorithm of Schmid
and Rooth (2001), are representative of this group.
In particular, they observe that certain tasks‚Äîof
which ours is clearly a member‚Äîonly beneÔ¨Åt when
a grammatical relation is marked with a high degree
of conÔ¨Ådence. They thus evaluate various thresholding techniques to boost precision to 90% from a
baseline of 75%. No speciÔ¨Åc results for subjects are
provided.
The other group of work describes the assignment
of functional tags to parsed text as a post-processing
step. Blaheta and Charniak (2000) use feature trees
to recover semantic roles and other information after parsing. For grammatical relations‚Äîthe category that includes subjects‚Äîthey show an FŒ≤=1 of
95.65%, although this Ô¨Ågure excludes constituents
that were incorrectly parsed (11% of the test set).
To our knowledge, no extant studies address the
assignment of grammatical relations to Arabic text.
Diab (2007) describes an SVM-based base phrase
chunker that achieves an FŒ≤=1 of 94.92% for base
NPs, but subjects are not always co-extensive with

base (non-recursive) NPs. This is especially true of
Arabic, in which the
iDafa construct, a type
of recursive NP, is a characteristic feature. Moreover, we are unaware of any prior work that uses a
CRF classiÔ¨Åer to identify subjects.

Conclusion

We have presented a sequence classiÔ¨Åer that detects NP subjects in verb-initial Arabic clauses with
greater accuracy than current statistical parsers. Using a simple decoder integration technique, we have
shown that knowledge of subject spans does allow
more possibilities for accurate phrase re-ordering. In
future experiments, we will use word alignments to
improve the decoder feature.
