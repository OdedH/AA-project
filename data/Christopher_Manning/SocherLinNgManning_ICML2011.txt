Abstract
Recursive structure is commonly found in the
inputs of diﬀerent modalities such as natural
scene images or natural language sentences.
Discovering this recursive structure helps us
to not only identify the units that an image or
sentence contains but also how they interact
to form a whole. We introduce a max-margin
structure prediction architecture based on recursive neural networks that can successfully
recover such structure both in complex scene
images as well as sentences. The same algorithm can be used both to provide a competitive syntactic parser for natural language sentences from the Penn Treebank and to outperform alternative approaches for semantic
scene segmentation, annotation and classiﬁcation. For segmentation and annotation our
algorithm obtains a new level of state-of-theart performance on the Stanford background
dataset (78.1%). The features from the image parse tree outperform Gist descriptors for
scene classiﬁcation by 4%.

1. Introduction
Recursive structure is commonly found in diﬀerent
modalities, as shown in Fig. 1. The syntactic rules
of natural language are known to be recursive, with
noun phrases containing relative clauses that themselves contain noun phrases, e.g., . . . the church which
has nice windows . . . . Similarly, one ﬁnds nested hierarchical structuring in scene images that capture both
part-of and proximity relationships. For instance, cars
are often on top of street regions. A large car region

mergings are learned.

can be recursively split into smaller car regions depicting parts such as tires and windows and these parts can
occur in other contexts such as beneath airplanes or in
houses. We show that recovering this structure helps
in understanding and classifying scene images. In this
paper, we introduce recursive neural networks (RNNs)
for predicting recursive structure in multiple modalities. We primarily focus on scene understanding, a
central task in computer vision often subdivided into
segmentation, annotation and classiﬁcation of scene
images. We show that our algorithm is a general tool

Parsing Natural Scenes and Natural Language with Recursive Neural Networks

for predicting tree structures by also using it to parse
natural language sentences.
Fig. 1 outlines our approach for both modalities. Images are oversegmented into small regions which often represent parts of objects or background. From
these regions we extract vision features and then map
these features into a “semantic” space using a neural network. Using these semantic region representations as input, our RNN computes (i) a score that
is higher when neighboring regions should be merged
into a larger region, (ii) a new semantic feature representation for this larger region, and (iii) its class label. Class labels in images are visual object categories
such as building or street. The model is trained so
that the score is high when neighboring regions have
the same class label. After regions with the same object label are merged, neighboring objects are merged
to form the full scene image. These merging decisions
implicitly deﬁne a tree structure in which each node
has associated with it the RNN outputs (i)-(iii), and
higher nodes represent increasingly larger elements of
the image.
The same algorithm is used to parse natural language
sentences. Again, words are ﬁrst mapped into a semantic space and then they are merged into phrases
in a syntactically and semantically meaningful order.
The RNN computes the same three outputs and attaches them to each node in the parse tree. The class
labels are phrase types such as noun phrase (NP) or
verb phrase (VP).
Contributions.
This is the ﬁrst deep learning
method to achieve state-of-the-art results on segmentation and annotation of complex scenes. Our recursive neural network architecture predicts hierarchical
tree structures for scene images and outperforms other
methods that are based on conditional random ﬁelds
or combinations of other methods. For scene classiﬁcation, our learned features outperform state of the
art methods such as Gist descriptors. Furthermore,
our algorithm is general in nature and can also parse
natural language sentences obtaining competitive performance on maximum length 15 sentences of the Wall
Street Journal dataset. Code for the RNN model is
available at www.socher.org.

2. Related Work
Five key research areas inﬂuence and motivate our
method. We brieﬂy outline connections and diﬀerences
between them. Due to space constraints, we cannot do
justice to the complete literature.
Scene Understanding has become a central task in
computer vision. The goal is to understand what ob-

jects are in a scene (annotation), where the objects
are located (segmentation) and what general scene
type the image shows (classiﬁcation). Some methods for this task such as (Aude & Torralba, 2001;
Schmid, 2006) rely on a global descriptor which can
do very well for classifying scenes into broad categories. However, these approaches fail to gain a
deeper understanding of the objects in the scene.
At the same time, there is a myriad of diﬀerent
approaches for image annotation and semantic segmentation of objects into regions (Rabinovich et al.,
2007; Gupta & Davis, 2008). Recently, these ideas
have been combined to provide more detailed scene
understanding (Hoiem et al., 2006; Li et al., 2009;
Gould et al., 2009; Socher & Fei-Fei, 2010).
Our algorithm parses an image; that is, it recursively
merges pairs of segments into super segments in a semantically and structurally coherent way. Many other
scene understanding approaches only consider a ﬂat
set of regions. Some approaches such as (Gould et al.,
2009) also consider merging operations. For merged
super segments, they compute new features. In contrast, our RNN-based method learns a representation
for super segments. This learned representation together with simple logistic regression outperforms the
original vision features and complex conditional random ﬁeld models. Furthermore, we show that the image parse trees are useful for scene classiﬁcation and
outperform global scene features such as Gist descriptors (Aude & Torralba, 2001).
Syntactic parsing of natural language sentences
is a central task in natural language processing (NLP)
because of its importance in mediating between linguistic expression and meaning. Our RNN architecture jointly learns how to parse and how to represent
phrases in a continuous vector space of features. This
allows us to embed both single lexical units and unseen, variable-sized phrases in a syntactically coherent order. The learned feature representations capture syntactic and compositional-semantic information. We show that they can help inform accurate
parsing decisions and capture interesting similarities
between phrases and sentences.
Using NLP techniques in computer vision. The
connection between NLP ideas such as parsing or
grammars and computer vision has been explored before (Zhu & Mumford, 2006; Tighe & Lazebnik, 2010;
Zhu et al., 2010; Siskind et al., 2007), among many
others. Our approach is similar on a high level, however, more general in nature. We show that the same
neural network based architecture can be used for both
natural language and image parsing.

Parsing Natural Scenes and Natural Language with Recursive Neural Networks

Deep Learning in vision applications can
ﬁnd lower dimensional representations for ﬁxed size
input images which are useful for classiﬁcation
(Hinton & Salakhutdinov, 2006). Recently, Lee et al.
(2009) were able to scale up deep networks to more
realistic image sizes. Using images of single objects
which were all in roughly the same scale, they were
able to learn parts and classify the images into object categories. Our approach diﬀers in several fundamental ways to any previous deep learning algorithm.
(i) Instead of learning features from raw, or whitened
pixels, we use oﬀ-the-shelf vision features of segments
obtained from oversegmented full scene images. (ii)
Instead of building a hierarchy using a combination of
convolutional and max-pooling layers, we recursively
apply the same network to merged segments and give
each of these a semantic category label. (iii) This is
the ﬁrst deep learning work which learns full scene segmentation, annotation and classiﬁcation. The objects
and scenes vary in scale, viewpoint, lighting etc.

features for the segments as described in Sec. 3.1 of
(Gould et al., 2009). These features include color and
texture features (Shotton et al., 2006), boosted pixel
classiﬁer scores (trained on the labeled training data),
as well as appearance and shape features.

Using deep learning for NLP applications has been
investigated by several people (inter alia Bengio et al.,
2003; Henderson, 2003; Collobert & Weston, 2008). In
most cases, the inputs to the neural networks are modiﬁed to be of equal size either via convolutional and
max-pooling layers or looking only at a ﬁxed size window around a speciﬁc word. Our approach is diﬀerent
in that it handles variable sized sentences in a natural way and captures the recursive nature of natural language. Furthermore, it jointly learns parsing
decisions, categories for each phrase and phrase feature embeddings which capture the semantics of their
constituents. In (Socher et al., 2010) we developed an
NLP speciﬁc parsing algorithm based on RNNs. That
algorithm is a special case of the one developed in this
paper.

In order to eﬃciently use neural networks in
NLP, neural language models (Bengio et al., 2003;
Collobert & Weston, 2008) map words to a vector representation. These representations are stored in a
word embedding matrix L ∈ Rn×|V | , where |V | is the
size of the vocabulary and n is the dimensionality of
the semantic space. This matrix usually captures cooccurrence statistics and its values are learned. Assume we are given an ordered list of Nwords words
from a sentence x. Each word i = 1, . . . , Nwords has
an associated vocabulary index k into the columns of
the embedding matrix. The operation to retrieve the
i-th word’s semantic representation can be seen as a
simple projection layer where we use a binary vector ek
which is zero in all positions except at the k-th index,

3. Mapping Segments and Words into
Syntactico-Semantic Space
This section contains an explanation of the inputs used
to describe scene images and natural language sentences and how they are mapped into the space in
which the RNN operates.
3.1. Input Representation of Scene Images
We closely follow the procedure described in
(Gould et al., 2009) to compute image features.
First, we oversegment an image x into superpixels (also called segments) using the algorithm from
(Comaniciu & Meer, 2002). Instead of computing
multiple oversegmentations, we only choose one set
of parameters. In our dataset, this results in an average of 78 segments per image. We compute 119

Next, we use a simple neural network layer to map
these features into the “semantic” n-dimensional space
in which the RNN operates. Let Fi be the features
described above for each segment i = 1, . . . , Nsegs in
an image. We then compute the representation:
ai

= f (W sem Fi + bsem ),

(1)

where W sem ∈ Rn×119 is the matrix of parameters
we want to learn, bsem is the bias and f is applied
element-wise and can be any sigmoid-like function. In
our vision experiments, we use the original sigmoid
function f (x) = 1/(1 + e−x ).
3.2. Input Representation for Natural
Language Sentences

ai = Lek ∈ Rn .

(2)

As with the image segments, the inputs are now
mapped to the semantic space of the RNN.

4. Recursive Neural Networks for
Structure Prediction
In our discriminative parsing architecture, the goal is
to learn a function f : X → Y, where Y is the set of all
possible binary parse trees. An input x consists of two
parts: (i) A set of activation vectors {a1 , . . . , aNsegs },
which represent input elements such as image segments
or words of a sentence. (ii) A symmetric adjacency
matrix A, where A(i, j) = 1, if segment i neighbors
j. This matrix deﬁnes which elements can be merged.
For sentences, this matrix has a special form with 1’s
only on the ﬁrst diagonal below and above the main
diagonal.

Figure 2. Illustration of the RNN training inputs: An adjacency matrix of image segments or words. A training
image (red and blue are diﬀerently labeled regions) deﬁnes
a set of correct trees which is oblivious to the order in
which segments with the same label are merged. See text
for details.

We denote the set of all possible trees that can be
constructed from an input x as T (x). When training
the visual parser, we have labels l for all segments.
Using these labels, we can deﬁne an equivalence set of
correct trees Y (x, l). A visual tree is correct if all adjacent segments that belong to the same class are merged
into one super segment before merges occur with super
segments of diﬀerent classes. This equivalence class
over trees is oblivious to how object parts are internally merged or how complete, neighboring objects are
merged into the full scene image. For training the language parser, the set of correct trees only has one element, the annotated ground truth tree: Y (x) = {y}.
Fig. 2 illustrates this.
4.1. Max-Margin Estimation
Similar to (Taskar et al., 2004), we deﬁne a structured
margin loss ∆(x, l, y ) for proposing a parse y for inˆ
ˆ
put x with labels l. The loss increases when a segment merges with another one of a diﬀerent label before merging with all its neighbors of the same label.
We can formulate this by checking whether the subtree subT ree(d) underneath a nonterminal node d in
y appears in any of the ground truth trees of Y (x, l):

∆(x, l, y ) = κ

where N (ˆ) is the set of non-terminal nodes and κ

is a parameter. The loss of the language parser
is the sum over incorrect spans in the tree, see
(Manning & Sch¨tze, 1999).

Given the training set, we search for a function f with
small expected loss on unseen inputs. We consider the

where θ are all the parameters needed to compute a
score s with an RNN. The score of a tree y is high if
the algorithm is conﬁdent that the structure of the tree
is correct. Tree scoring with RNNs will be explained
in detail below. In the max-margin estimation framework (Taskar et al., 2004; Ratliﬀ et al., 2007), we want
to ensure that the highest scoring tree is in the set
of correct trees: fθ (xi ) ∈ Y (xi , li ) for all training instances (xi , li ), i = 1, . . . , n. Furthermore, we want the
score of the highest scoring correct tree yi to be larger
up to a margin deﬁned by the loss ∆. ∀i, y ∈ T (xi ):
ˆ
s(RNN(θ, xi , yi )) ≥ s(RNN(θ, xi , y )) + ∆(xi , li , y ).

These desiderata lead us to the following regularized

Minimizing this objective maximizes the correct tree’s
score and minimizes (up to a margin) the score of the
highest scoring but incorrect tree.
Now that we deﬁned the general learning framework,
we will explain in detail how we predict parse trees
and compute their scores with RNNs.
4.2. Greedy Structure Predicting RNNs
We can now describe the RNN model that uses the activation vectors {a1 , . . . , aNsegs } and adjacency matrix
A (as deﬁned above) as inputs. There are more than
exponentially many possible parse trees and no eﬃcient dynamic programming algorithms for our RNN
setting. Therefore, we ﬁnd a greedy approximation.
We start by explaining the feed-forward process on a
test input.
Using the adjacency matrix A, the algorithm ﬁnds the
pairs of neighboring segments and adds their activations to a set of potential child node pairs:
C = {[ai , aj ] : A(i,j)=1}.

(6)

In the small toy image of Fig. 2, we would have the following pairs: {[a1 , a2 ], [a1 , a3 ], [a2 , a1 ], [a2 , a4 ], [a3 , a1 ],
[a3 , a4 ], [a4 , a2 ], [a4 , a3 ], [a4 , a5 ], [a5 , a4 ]}. Each pair of
activations is concatenated and given as input to a

Parsing Natural Scenes and Natural Language with Recursive Neural Networks

of the tree. The ﬁnal score that we need for structure
prediction is simply the sum of all the local decisions:
∑
s(RNN(θ, xi , y )) =
ˆ
sd .
(11)

s = W score p

neural network. The network computes the potential
parent representation for these possible child nodes:
p(i,j)

= f (W [ci ; cj ] + b).

(7)

With this representation we can compute a local
score using a simple inner product with a row vector
W score ∈ R1×n :
s(i,j) = W score p(i,j) .

(8)

The network performing these functions is illustrated
in Fig. 3. Training will aim to increase scores of
good segment pairs (with the same label) and decrease
scores of pairs with diﬀerent labels, unless no more
good pairs are left.
After computing the scores for all pairs of neighboring
segments, the algorithm selects the pair which received
the highest score. Let the score sij be the highest
score; we then (i) Remove [ai , aj ] from C, as well as
all other pairs with either ai or aj in them. (ii) Update
the adjacency matrix with a new row and column that
reﬂects that the new segment has the neighbors of both
child segments. (iii) Add potential new child pairs to
C:
C
C

= C − {[ai , aj ]} − {[aj , ai ]}
(10)
= C ∪ {[p(i,j) , ak ] : ak has boundary with i or j}

In the case of the image in Fig. 2, if we merge [a4 , a5 ],
then C = {[a1 , a2 ], [a1 , a3 ], [a2 , a1 ], [a2 , p(4,5) ], [a3 , a1 ],
[a3 , p(4,5) ], [p(4,5) , a2 ], [p(4,5) , a3 ]}.
The new potential parents and corresponding scores of
new child pairs are computed with the same neural network of Eq. 7. For instance, we compute, p(2,(4,5)) =
f (W [a2 , p(4,5) ]+b), p(3,(4,5)) = f (W [a3 , p(4,5) ]+b), etc.
The process repeats (treating the new pi,j just like any
other segment) until all pairs are merged and only one
parent activation is left in the set C. This activation
then represents the entire image. Hence, the same
network (with parameters W, b, W score ) is recursively
applied until all vector pairs are collapsed. The tree
is then recovered by unfolding the collapsed decisions
down to the original segments which are the leaf nodes

To ﬁnish the example, assume the next highest score
was s((4,5),3) , so we merge the (4, 5) super segment
with segment 3, so C = {[a1 , a2 ], [a1 , p((4,5),3 )], [a2 , a1 ],
[a2 , p((4,5),3) ], [p((4,5),3) , a1 ], [p((4,5),3) , a2 ]}. If we then
merge segments (1, 2), we get C = {[p(1,2) , p((4,5),3) ],
[p((4,5),3) , p(1,2) ]}, leaving us with only the last choice
of merging the diﬀerently labeled super segments. This
results in the bottom tree in Fig. 2.
4.3. Category Classiﬁers in the Tree
One of the main advantages of our approach is that
each node of the tree built by the RNN has associated
with it a distributed feature representation (the parent vector p). We can leverage this representation by
adding to each RNN parent node (after removing the
scoring layer) a simple softmax layer to predict class
labels, such as visual or syntactic categories:
labelp = sof tmax(W label p).

(12)

When minimizing the cross-entropy error of this softmax layer, the error will backpropagate and inﬂuence
both the RNN parameters and the word representations.
4.4. Improvements for Language Parsing
Since in a sentence each word only has 2 neighbors,
less-greedy search algorithms such as a bottom-up
beam search can be used. In our case, beam search
ﬁlls in elements of the chart in a similar fashion as the
CKY algorithm. However, unlike standard CNF grammars, in our grammar each constituent is represented
by a continuous feature vector and not just a discrete
category. Hence we cannot prune based on category
equality. We could keep the k-best subtrees in each
cell but initial tests showed no improvement over just
keeping the single best constituent in each cell.
Since there is only a single correct tree the second maximization in the objective of Eq. 5 can be dropped. For
further details see (Socher et al., 2010).

5. Learning
Our objective J of Eq. 5 is not diﬀerentiable due to
the hinge loss. Therefore, we will generalize gradient descent via the subgradient method (Ratliﬀ et al.,
2007) which computes a gradient-like direction called
the subgradient. Let θ = (W sem , W, W score , W label )
be the set of our model parameters,1 then the gradi1

We use L-BFGS over the complete training data to
minimize the objective. Generally, this could cause
problems due to the non-diﬀerentiable objective function. However, we did not observe problems in practice.

6. Experiments
We evaluate our RNN architecture on both vision and
NLP tasks. The only parameters to tune are n, the
size of the hidden layer; κ, the penalization term for incorrect parsing decisions and λ, the regularization parameter. We found that our method is robust to these
parameters, varying in performance by only a few percent for some parameter combinations. With proper
regularization, training accuracy was highly correlated
with test performance. We chose n = 100, κ = 0.05
and λ = 0.001.
6.1. Scene Understanding: Segmentation and
Annotation
The vision experiments are performed on the Stanford background dataset2 . We ﬁrst provide accuracy
of multiclass segmentation where each pixel is labeled
with a semantic class. Like (Gould et al., 2009), we
run ﬁve-fold cross validation and report pixel level accuracy in Table 1. After training the full RNN model
which inﬂuences the leaf embeddings through backpropagation, we can simply label the superpixels by
their most likely class based on the multinomial distribution from the softmax layer at the leaf nodes. As
shown in Table 1, we outperform previous methods
that report results on this data, such as the recent
methods of (Tighe & Lazebnik, 2010). We report accuracy of an additional logistic regression baseline to
show the improvement using the neural network layer
instead of the raw vision features. We also tried using just a single neural network layer followed by a
softmax layer. This corresponds to the leaf nodes of
the RNN and performed about 2% worse than the full
RNN model.

6.2. Scene Classiﬁcation
The Stanford background dataset can be roughly categorized into three scene types: city, countryside and
sea-side. We label the images with these three labels and train a linear SVM using the average over all
nodes’ activations in the tree as features. Hence, we

sentations of the RNN. With an accuracy of 88.1%, we
outperform the state-of-the art features for scene categorization, Gist descriptors (Aude & Torralba, 2001),
which obtain only 84.0%. We also compute a baseline
using our RNN. In the baseline we use as features only
the very top node of the scene parse tree. We note that
while this captures enough information to perform well
above a random baseline (71.0% vs. 33.3%), it does
lose some information that is captured by averaging
all tree nodes.
6.3. Nearest Neighbor Scene Subtrees
In order to show that the learned feature representations capture important appearance and label information even for higher nodes in the tree, we visualize
nearest neighbor super segments. We parse all test
images with the trained RNN. We then ﬁnd subtrees
whose nodes have all been assigned the same class label by our algorithm and save the top nodes’ vector
representation of that subtree. This also includes initial superpixels. Using this representation, we compute nearest neighbors across all images and all such
subtrees (ignoring their labels). Fig. 5 shows the results. The ﬁrst image is a random subtree’s top node
and the remaining regions are the closest subtrees in
the dataset in terms of Euclidean distance between the
vector representations.

6.4. Supervised Parsing
In all experiments our word and phrase representations
are 100-dimensional. We train all models on the Wall
Street Journal section of the Penn Treebank using the
standard training (2–21), development (22) and test
(23) splits.
The ﬁnal unlabeled bracketing F-measure (see
(Manning & Sch¨tze, 1999) for details) of our lanu
guage parser is 90.29%, compared to 91.63% for the
widely used Berkeley parser (Petrov et al., 2006) (development F1 is virtually identical with 92.06% for the
RNN and 92.08% for the Berkeley parser). Unlike
most previous systems, our parser does not provide
a parent with information about the syntactic categories of its children. This shows that our learned,
continuous representations capture enough syntactic
information to make good parsing decisions.
While our parser does not yet perform as well as the
current version of the Berkeley parser, it performs respectably (1.3% diﬀerence in unlabeled F1). On a
2.6GHz laptop our Matlab implementation needs 72
seconds to parse 421 sentences of length less than 15.
6.5. Nearest Neighbor Phrases
In the same way we collected nearest neighbors for
nodes in the scene tree, we can compute nearest neighbor embeddings of multi-word phrases. We embed
complete sentences from the WSJ dataset into the

Parsing Natural Scenes and Natural Language with Recursive Neural Networks

syntactico-semantic feature space. In Fig. 6 we show
several example sentences which had similar sentences
in the dataset. Our examples show that the learned
features capture several interesting semantic and syntactic similarities between sentences or phrases.

7. Conclusion
We have introduced a recursive neural network architecture which can successfully merge image segments or natural language words based on deep learned
semantic transformations of their original features.
Our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches
in segmentation, annotation and scene classiﬁcation.
