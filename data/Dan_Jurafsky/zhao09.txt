Abstract
Among the many factors that affect phonetic variation, two of them, low word frequency and speech in noise (Lombard speech), are
linked to stronger or fuller realizations of segments. Noise and low usage frequency are both factors that may lead to perceptual difﬁculty
suggesting that the strengthening due to these two factors may be related. To understand how these two factors relate to each other and
to see if they play a similar role with respect to suprasegmental phenomena like tone, we investigated the effect of ambient noise and
word usage frequency on tone production in Cantonese. We recorded Cantonese monosyllabic words of high and low usage frequency in
both normal and Lombard speech styles, controlling for segmental and other factors and measured f0. We found that both ambient noise
and lexical frequency inﬂuence tonal production. All six tones are produced with higher f0 in the presence of noise. Usage frequency
affects f0 realization as well, but only for words with mid-range (mid-level or mid-rising) tones. Low-frequency words with mid-range
tones are produced with higher f0 than frequent words. Extending earlier work showing greater vowel-space dispersion in less frequent
words, we also found that the f0 trajectories of less frequent words are more dispersed than that of their more frequent counterparts,
especially for mid–low tones. This dispersion does not occur for Lombard speech. Our results suggest that different aspects of speech
production may account for the strengthening of speech in noise and in low-frequency words.

1. Introduction
Understanding the causes of variation in the surface
form of words is crucial to building models of spoken word
production and recognition. One of the earliest-reported
correlates of phonetic variation is word frequency, noted
by Sibawayhi, the Arabic grammarian of the 8th century
(Al-Nassir, 1993; Carter, 2004) and well-known by early
modern linguists (Schuchardt, 1885; Zipf, 1929; inter alia).
A number of more recent studies show that frequent or
predictable words are shorter and display various other
lenited characteristics such as reduced vowels and simpliﬁed or deleted codas compared to less frequent words. Less
frequent words are longer and have stronger or fuller forms
(Aylett & Turk, 2006; Bell, Brenier, Gregory, Girand, &
Jurafsky, 2009; Bybee, 2000; Fidelhotz, 1975; FoslerLussier & Morgan, 1998; Hooper, 1976; Munson, 2007;
Pluymaekers, Ernestus, & Baayen, 2005; Rhodes, 1992,

1996). Strengthened and longer forms are also associated
with another cause of variation: ambient noise. Speech
produced in noise is often referred to as Lombard speech
(Lombard, 1911). Modiﬁcations due to noise vary somewhat depending on the type of noise and the task, but in
general Lombard speech has increased duration and
energy, higher f0, and segmental effects such as changes
in spectral tilt and an increase in the energy center of
gravity (e.g. Draegert, 1951; Junqua, 1993; Lane & Tranel,
1971; Summers, Pisoni, Bernacki, Pedlow, & Stokes, 1988).
Thus both (low) word frequency and Lombard speech
are associated with strengthening such as increased
duration and energy and, at least for Lombard speech,
higher f0. Although these phenomena have not previously
been considered together, the same explanation has often
been independently offered for both: phonetic strengthening may aid perception, either by the hearer or by the
speaker (in monitoring their own speech). Thus for
example the Hyperarticulation and Hypoarticulation
(H&H) model (Lindblom, 1990) claims that speakers
will produce strengthened phonetic forms to counteract

difﬁculties in comprehension of the sort that might arise
from low word predictability or from ambiguity due to
noise. Such a model is supported by a wide variety of other
evidence (summarized below) showing that less predictable
elements are more hyperarticulated than more predictable
elements (e.g., Aylett, 2000; Bell et al., 2003; Raymond,
Dautricourt & Hume, 2006; Jurafsky, Bell, Gregory, &
Raymond, 2001; Liberman, 1963).
Noise and usage frequency are linked in another way. In a
Bayesian or ‘‘noisy channel’’ model of comprehension, a
comprehender chooses the interpretation which is most
probable given the input. For word recognition, a Bayesian
recognizer (Norris, 2006; Jurafsky, 2003; Norris & McQueen,
2008) selects the word which has the highest probability
given the speech input. Bayesian models integrate two kinds
of probability for each candidate word: the prior probability
of the word (how expected the word is a priori) and the
likelihood of the acoustic evidence given the word (how much
the acoustic input matches our expectations of how this word
should be acoustically realized). Low word frequency
decreases the prior probability of the word; noisy acoustics
decreases the likelihood of the acoustics, given the word.
Despite the fact that Lombard speech and word usage
frequency can both play a role in models like H&H and
Bayesian recognition, we know very little about the
similarities and differences of their effects on phonetic
realization.
Another important gap in our understanding of these
sources of strengthening is related to their impact on
suprasegmental phenomena, such as lexical tone. Recent
research has suggested that speakers might make use of
prosodic prominence as a linguistic means to achieve smooth
signal redundancy and therefore improve communication
robustness (Aylett, 2000; Aylett & Turk, 2004). We know
that both usage frequency and noise have impacts on f0; rare
words are more likely to have a pitch accent in English and
Dutch (Pan & Hirschberg, 2000), and f0 is generally higher in
Lombard speech (Draegert, 1951; Junqua, 1993; Lombard,
1911). Assuming both word frequency and ambient noise are
linked with changes in f0 as a consequence of a smooth
proﬁle of signal redundancy, we know very little about how
these two phenomena, which emphasize different aspects of
the predictability of the signal, behave similarly or differently. Similarly, we do not know how strengthening would
be manifested on f0 phenomena like lexical tone. Lexical
tone is contrastive; a change in f0 can change the identity of a
lexical tone. Does the phonemic nature of lexical tone
inﬂuence the effect of word frequency and the Lombard
reﬂex on f0 in tone languages?
In the next two sections, we summarize some of what is
known about usage frequency and Lombard speech, before
turning to our new study.
1.1. Word frequency and production
The idea that more frequent words tend to be shorter
than less frequent words was actually ﬁrst noticed in the

8th century by the Arabic grammarians (Al-Nassir, 1993;
Carter, 2004) and rediscovered by linguists in the 19th and
early 20th century (Schuchardt, 1885; Zipf, 1929, among
others). Modern studies ﬁrst demonstrated the effect of
frequency on lenited pronunciation. Fidelhotz (1975), for
example, showed that low-frequency words like forfend
were less likely to have a schwa vowel in the ﬁrst syllable
than high-frequency words like forget. Rhodes (1992, 1996)
showed that /t/s in low-frequency words were less likely to
ﬂap than /t/s in high-frequency words. Bybee (2000) found
that deletion was less likely in low-frequency words than in
high-frequency words.
Recent studies have found similar effects in natural
spoken corpora. Bybee (1996) showed that word-ﬁnal /t/
and /d/ deletion rates in a corpus of spoken Chicano
English were lower in low-frequency words (34.3%) than in
high-frequency words (54.5%). Gregory et al. (1999) and
Jurafsky et al. (2001) conﬁrmed this lower rate of ﬁnal /t/
and /d/ deletion for low-frequency words in a corpus of
American English telephone conversations by using multiple regression to control for factors such as segmental
context, rate of speech, word-length in phones, and
neighboring disﬂuencies. They also found that lowfrequency words were longer than high-frequency words.
Patterson and Connine (2001) investigated ﬂap production
in the telephone speech corpus Switchboard. They found
that the probability of occurrence of ﬂaps in a medial /t/
position was a function of the lexical frequency of the
carrier word. The probability of ﬂapping was smaller for
lower frequency words (76%) than high frequency words
(95%). Aylett and Turk (2004) examined syllable duration
in the HCRC Map Task Corpus of task-oriented dialogs
between Glaswegian English speakers. They found that
syllables from low-frequency words were longer than
syllables from high-frequency words, after controlling for
many other factors.
More recent studies on vowel production, such as Aylett
and Turk (2006), found that vowels showed increased
centralization with increased predictability. Munson (2007)
had subjects read high-frequency and low-frequency CVC
words and studied the resulting vowel-space dispersion. He
found that low-frequency words had an expanded vowel
space compared to high-frequency words.
In general, whether all these results are caused by a
strengthening of low-frequency words or a weakening or
lenition of high-frequency words is still not well understood. Some models argue that both factors may play a
role (see, e.g., Bell et al., 2009) and other models such as
Aylett and Turk (2004) propose that pronunciation
strength is inversely related to word frequency and therefore no default realization is required.
Many experiments have also focused on factors closely
related to frequency, including predictability and frequencyweighted neighborhood density. In a classic early study,
Liberman (1963) showed that words were less reduced when
they occurred in less predictive sentence contexts. Gregory,
Raymond, Bell, Fosler-Lussier & Jurafsky (1999), Jurafsky

ARTICLE IN PRESS

et al. (2001) and Raymond et al. (2006) found that
(contextually) less predictable content words were longer
and less likely to have /t/ or /d/ deleted. Bell et al. (2003)
found that unpredictable function words had less vowel
reduction, less coda deletion and were longer. Pluymaekers
et al. (2005) showed similar effects of local predictability on
reduction in seven Dutch adverbs. Aylett and Turk (2004)
found that the predictability and also the given/new status of
a word affected its duration. In addition to predictability, the
frequency-weighted neighborhood of a word has also been
shown to inﬂuence phonetic production. Scarborough
(2004), for instance, found that French words from dense
neighborhoods had higher degree of nasal and vowel-tovowel coarticulation. Munson and Solomon (2004) reported
that vowels were produced with a higher degree of dispersion
in words with many neighbors.
In summary, lexical frequency and other related lexical
factors have been shown to affect a wide variety of
phonetic variables, including vowels (longer, less use of
schwas, and expanded vowel space) as well as consonants
(longer, less ﬂapping, less palatalization, and less coda
deletion). Lexical frequency and predictability have also
been shown to have an effect on prosodic phenomena: low
frequency or low predictability words are more likely to
receive pitch accent (Pan & Hirschberg, 2000). One
important class of phonetic phenomena, however, has not
been investigated for the inﬂuence of word frequency:
lexical tone.
Should we expect to see the effect of frequency on tone?
It is very likely that there is a frequency effect, given any of
the various models that have been proposed to explain the
effect of word frequency on phonetic reduction at the
segmental or prosodic level. These include the H&H
Articulation model of Lindblom, which suggests that
speakers use hyperarticulation or hypoarticulation based
on the potential needs of the hearer (Lindblom, 1990), or
models based on lexical access (Munson, 2007) mediated
by an articulatory pipeline (Pluymaekers et al., 2005),
models based on smoothing language redundancy (Aylett
& Turk, 2004) or models of prosodic strength (Kochanski
& Shih, 2003). We do not intend in this paper to compare
or contrast these different potential models, and indeed it
seems likely that frequency effects reﬂect more than one
such causal factor. We note, however, that all of these
models explain segmental or prosodic weakening of
frequent forms with general mechanisms, suggesting that
the effects should be observed across a variety of surface
phonetic manifestations including the use of f0 to realize
lexical tone.
1.2. Lombard speech
As early as 1911, Etienne Lombard observed that talkers
adjusted their speech and increased vocal effort when
speaking in noise. He proposed that the acoustic modiﬁcation was a result of maintaining the ability to self-monitor
through the auditory feedback loop. Later studies reported

233

various aspects of this acoustic modiﬁcation. For instance,
Draegert (1951) found, in utterances with the presence of
noise, an increase in intensity, a change in the distribution
of spectral energy, and modiﬁed vowel quality. The
observed hyperarticulation effect in Lombard speech
extends to suprasegmental production as well: changes in
the prosodic characteristics of Lombard speech. Hanley
and Steer (1949) showed that in the presence of noise
speakers talked much louder and increased the duration of
the utterance. Draegert (1951) and Junqua (1993) found
that when speaking with masking noise, speakers not only
reduced speech rate, but also used higher f0. Other studies
further show that speakers raise f0 to different degrees
according to different levels of noise (Summers et al.,
1988).
Some other studies argue that the phonetic hyperarticulation in Lombard speech is not just a result of our selfmonitoring needs. The acoustic enhancement in noise
serves to improve communicative effectiveness in a
degraded environment (Letowski, Frank, & Caravella,
1993) and to optimize information transfer to listeners
(Lane & Tranel, 1971). One inadequacy of earlier research
on Lombard speech is that it focuses on ambient noise as
the sole variable, without taking into consideration the
tasks and the linguistic content involved in speech
production. Only recently have studies started to show
that communicative factors and the informational status of
the word might also play a role in the execution of this
noise-induced hyperarticulation. For instance, Lu and
Cooke (2008) examined the acoustic differences in the
Lombard realization of utterances from pairs of speakers
with or without a collaborative task involved. In one
condition, subjects were asked to perform a puzzle-solving
task with a partner when speaking in noise, while in the
other condition, subjects were asked to speak aloud while
solving the puzzle alone without interacting with a partner.
They found that both groups produced acoustic modiﬁcation consistent with the Lombard effect. However, the
Lombard effect produced by the group performing a
collaborative task with a partner had a stronger effect.
Besides communicative factors, recent studies such as Patel
and Schell (2008) showed that word meaning also plays a
role in the degree of phonetic strengthening in Lombard
speech. They found that at moderate noise levels, most
word types appeared to be uniformly boosted in f0,
intensity and duration. However, as the noise level
increased, words referring to agents, objects and locations
were disproportionately elongated and raised in f0
compared with the rest. They argue that linguistic content
shapes the magnitude of the Lombard effect, with f0 and
duration serving as primary cues for marking the saliency
of those information-bearing word types.
While we thus know quite a bit about English Lombard
speech, no systematic study has looked at the impact of the
Lombard reﬂex on the realization of lexical tones in tonal
languages. It is not clear whether the prosodic changes
observed in English Lombard speech (such as higher f0)

ARTICLE IN PRESS

would also be found in the production of lexical tones. If
Lombard articulation plays a universal role in increasing the
rate of vocal fold vibration, we would expect to see the same
rise in f0 in Lombard realizations of tones as we observe in
English Lombard speech (e.g., Draegert, 1951; Junqua, 1993;
Summers et al., 1988). Alternatively, if the Lombard reﬂex
plays its role in a more complex way, we might expect to see
different effects on lexical f0 than on the intonational
contour, given lexical f0’s phonemic nature.
1.3. Our approach
In this study we offer a preliminary investigation of the
role of usage frequency and ambient noise on tone
production in Cantonese. We examine words of low usage
frequency and words of high usage frequency, in noise and
no-noise conditions. Our goal is to investigate how the
factors of rarity and noise affect the realization of f0, and
to understand the similarities and differences between the
two.
We hypothesize that the tones of low-frequency words
and tones produced in the presence of noise will both be
hyperarticulated when compared with their high-frequency
and no-noise counterparts. We can imagine a few possible
scenarios for the realization of this hyperarticulation. If the
‘‘function’’ of hyperarticulation is to make elements louder
and/or phonetically stronger in other aspects, whether for
our own needs of self-monitoring or for the beneﬁt of
listeners, all tones should be realized with higher f0, since a
higher f0 increases the spectral energy overall. Higher f0 is
in general correlated with increased vocal efforts in
articulation and with signal intensity (e.g. Junqua, 1993;
Picheny, Durlach, & Braida, 1986; Rostolland, 1982). This
scenario thus predicts an overall increase in mean f0 for all
lexical tones, whether they are high or low tone.
Alternatively, if the function of the hyperarticulation is
to make elements more distinct within the phonemic tone
inventory, we might expect to see higher tones getting
higher and lower tones get lower, or dynamic tones getting
‘‘stretched’’, so that the high f0 point of the dynamic tone
gets higher and the low point gets lower, or some other
such reconﬁguration in the use of the tone space to increase
the contrast between tones.
We therefore propose to investigate the details of how
noise and usage frequency affect the f0 realization of words
with each lexical tone, focusing on whether we see the tones
behave similarly or differently from each other.
We will also examine the relationship of these two
factors with other potential variables including the gender
of the speaker.
2. Method
2.1. Test language: Cantonese
Our test language is Cantonese, a Chinese language with
a rich inventory of both static and dynamic tones.

Fig. 1. f0 contours of Cantonese tones.

Cantonese has six contrastive tones, including three level
tones that contrast in f0 height (high-level: tone 1; midlevel: tone 3; low-level: tone 6), two rising tones (high-rise:
tone 2; mid-rise: tone 5), and a low-falling tone (tone 4)
(Cheung, 1986).1 Fig. 1 shows the f0 contours of the six
Cantonese tones that we will be investigating.
2.2. Subjects
Eight native Hong Kong Cantonese speakers, four males
and four females, participated in the experiment for $10
compensation for each session. Subjects’ age ranged from
20 to 52. All of them were born and raised in Hong Kong
and had lived in the United States for less than 3 years. All
speakers were at least college-educated and were literate.
The speakers reported no known speech, language or
hearing disorders.
2.3. Materials
The stimuli consisted of 92 words paired between highfrequency usage and low-frequency usage, and balanced
across tones (words are listed in the appendix). A Chinese
talking syllabary of the Cantonese dialect (Huang, 1997)
was used as the reference for selecting words of each
standard citation tone. Word token frequency was
calculated from Academia Sinica’s Balanced Corpus of
Modern Chinese (Hsu & Huang, 1995; Huang & Chen,
1992), which has about ﬁve million words of written
Chinese sampled from different genres and styles.
1
There are three additional ‘‘checked tones’’, i.e. syllables ending with
unreleased stops, which mainly differ with the other tones in duration.
Checked syllables are systematically shorter in duration than unchecked
ones but do not differ from the unchecked tones in pitch height, and were
not included in the study.

ARTICLE IN PRESS

The raw token frequency was transformed into log
frequency. High-frequency words were chosen from the top
quartile of the frequency range and low-frequency words
were chosen from the bottom quartile of the frequency
range. The mean log frequency of high-frequency words
was 3.655 and that of low-frequency words was 0.969.
Ideally one would calculate the word frequency from a
psycholinguistically designed corpus of Cantonese. Chinese, however, is diglossic; Cantonese is a spoken language
and it is common in reading experiments like ours to use
written frequencies. The Chinese written by Cantonese
speakers is the same as standard written Chinese except for
dialect-speciﬁc lexical items. Due to the unavailability of a
balanced Cantonese corpus, we therefore based our counts
on the Sinica corpus of written Chinese. We did check our
frequencies against a corpus of Chinese presumably written
by and/or for Cantonese speakers: the corpus of Hong
Kong Newspaper text released by the Linguistic Data
Consortium (LDC, 2000), containing 18,147 news articles
(about 10 million Chinese characters total). All our highfrequency and low-frequency words were still in the same
frequency bin according to this LDC written Cantonese
corpus.
All high/low frequency word pairs were monosyllabic
with CV or CVC structure. The syllable structure within
each pair of words was kept constant. Syllables were
chosen with the initial consonant, vowel and coda matched
within each pair as much as possible. Voicing and the
manner of the initial consonants were matched as much as
possible. Contrastive vowel length was also consistent
within each pair. Only words with nasal codas were used in
CVC word pairs and in each pair the same nasal coda was
selected. We tried to avoid using homophone pairs to
minimize confounding factors (see Caramazza, Costa,
Miozzo, & Bi, 2001; Jescheniak & Levelt, 1994). w2 tests
showed that the high-frequency word list and the lowfrequency list did not differ signiﬁcantly in the manner of
the initial consonant (w2 [2] ¼ .913, po.633), the length of
the vowel (w2 [1] ¼ .289, po.591) or the presence/absence
of the coda (w2 [1] ¼ .013, po.908). Due to our attempt to
control for phonological and frequency constraints, we
ended up with a few words in our high-frequency stimuli
that could be considered ‘‘closed class’’ according to some
classiﬁcations (such as Zhang, 2003). We will come back to
this limitation at the end.
After a set of potential stimuli was chosen, it was given
to two native Cantonese speakers to rate the familiarity of
the words on a scale from 1 to 10. The ﬁnal 92 stimuli used
in the study were all rated above 6 on the familiarity scale
of 10. The mean rating of high-frequency words’ familiarity
was 7.2 and that of low-frequency words was 6.9.
2.4. Procedure
The recording took place in the sound booth of the
Phonetics Lab at Stanford University. Subjects participated in two recording sessions. In the ﬁrst session they

235

recorded the word list under normal speaking condition.
Subjects were presented with words in traditional Chinese
orthography, in a random order one at a time on a
computer screen. They produced the words in isolation
self-paced without intervention and the audio was recorded
through a Shure microphone (SM10A). After two weeks,
subjects came to the lab again and recorded the same set of
materials while listening to a signal containing 75 dB white
noise. The noise was calibrated by a sound-level meter
prior to the experiment and it was presented binaurally
through a Sennheiser headphone (HD 280). Both sessions
were recorded using a Panasonic Professional DAT
recorder at a sampling frequency of 44.1 K. The data were
later analyzed with Praat (Boersma & Weenink, 2000).
2.5. Measurements
The sound ﬁles for both conditions were segmented into
words, using the inter-word silence as the criterion. Word
boundaries were hand-labeled and annotated by the ﬁrst
author using Praat. After the boundaries were handdelineated, f0 was automatically measured for each word
by a commonly used Praat script created by Xu (2006).
In order to capture as much tonal information as
possible, the f0 values of the tone trajectory of each word
were measured at ten equidistant points. Since the f0 at the
onset of the vowel may be perturbed by the preceding
consonant (e.g. Hombert, Ohala, & Ewan, 1979) the f0 of
the initial vocalic segment was not taken into consideration
and hence f0 was measured starting 10% of the way
through the vocalic segment from the voicing onset (10%,
20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 100%).
3. Analysis and results
3.1. Effect of noise and lexical frequency on f0
In order to examine the effect of noise and usage
frequency on f0, we calculated the mean f0 for each time
point by averaging across all tokens of the same tone type
at the same time point produced by all speakers. Fig. 2
shows the f0 trajectories of six tones produced in normal
and Lombard conditions; Fig. 3 plots the f0 trajectories of
six tones separately for high-frequency and low-frequency
words.
A Repeated Measures ANOVA was used to examine
whether speaking condition (normal vs. Lombard), lexical
frequency category of the word (high vs. low) and tone
types (tones 1–6), as well as speakers’ gender had a
signiﬁcant inﬂuence on the production of words’ overall
mean f0 calculated by averaging across the ten points of all
tones of all speakers.
Lexical frequency and speaking condition both had
signiﬁcant main effects on mean f0 (Flexical_frequency(1,5)
¼ 18.929, po.007; Fspeaking_condition(1,5) ¼ 6.503, po.043).
Low-frequency words were produced with a higher f0 and
speaking in noise also resulted in a higher f0. In addition,

effects on the mean f0 (Ftone_type(5,25) ¼ 49.648, po.000;
Fgender(1,5) ¼ 66.756, po.000).
There was also a signiﬁcant interaction between tone
type and lexical frequency (F(5,25) ¼ 4.786, po.003). The
interaction, visible in Fig. 3, suggested that the change in f0

between high-frequency and low-frequency words differed
by the tone type and not every tone was equally subject to
the inﬂuence of lexical frequency. The two tones that were
inﬂuenced by usage frequency were mid-level tone 3 and
low-rising tone 5, both of which were mid-range tones in
Cantonese. Post-hoc Bonferroni tests show that lexical

frequency had a signiﬁcant effect on tone 3 (F(1,7) ¼
13.147, po.008) and tone 5 (F(1,7) ¼ 8.151, 0o.025). Lowfrequency words of mid-level tone 3 were produced higher
in f0 than high-frequency words (Mlow-frequency ¼ 173.096,
Mhigh-frequency ¼ 162.182). The f0 of low-frequency lowrising tone 5 words was also higher than that of high-

frequency tones 5 words (Mlow-frequency ¼ 155.502, Mhighfrequency ¼ 151.200).
In contrast with the frequency effect, there was no
interaction between ambient noise and tone type. As
suggested by Fig. 2, the Lombard effect on lexical tones
was a universal raising in f0 across all tone types.

3.2. Interim discussion
Our results show that speech style and lexical frequency
both inﬂuence tone production. Consistent with previous
ﬁndings in non-tonal languages like English (Junqua,
1993), Lombard production of tones in Cantonese is
characterized by raised f0. The lack of interaction with
tone type suggests that this rise occurs across all tone types.
In contrast, usage frequency does not affect all tones
equally. Low-frequency words of mid-level (tone 3) and
low-rising (tone 5) tones are more likely to be raised in f0.
The fact that Lombard speech leads to higher f0 for all
tones, while usage frequency only inﬂuences part of the
tonal inventory, suggests that the two kinds of hyperarticulation may play different functional roles. The universality of higher f0 in noise suggests a strengthening-oriented
hyperarticulation, functioning to phonetically strengthen
some acoustic dimensions, such as f0 or intensity, whether
for self-monitoring for auditory feedback (Lombard, 1911)
or in a listener-directed effect similar to the many kinds of
clear speech such as speech to the hard-of-hearing (Picheny
et al., 1986).
Since low word frequency, by contrast, only affects a
subset of tones, it seems unlikely to be functioning to
increase the phonetic strength; there is no obvious reason
to limit phonetic strengthening to only a subset of the
tones. By contrast, a distinction model, which is sensitive to
the phonemic structure of the tonal inventory, and whose
function was to make tones more perceptually distinct
from each other, might predict changes in only a subset of
the tones, perhaps to help separate some speciﬁc neighboring tones of high confusability.
In order to tease apart these two models, then, it is
important to come up with a metric for tone distinctiveness, and measure the effects of lexical usage frequency and
Lombard speech on this metric. In the next section we
introduce such a measure: tone space, investigating whether
the phonemic structure of the tonal inventory may help in
understanding these differential roles of lexical frequency
and ambient noise.
4. Hyperarticulation and tone-space adjustment
4.1. Overview
In the previous section we suggested that different
functional aims might explain the fact that ambient noise
leads to higher f0 for all tones, while lexical frequency does
not inﬂuence all tones uniformly. Perhaps where noise is to
phonetic strength of individual tones, lexical frequency
plays its functional role in making tones more phonemically
contrastive or distinct from one another.
This idea that one function of hyperarticulation could
be to make phonemes more distinct was ﬁrst suggested
for segmental domain by Wright (2003), Munson and
Solomon (2004), and Munson (2007), who showed that
(point) vowels of low-frequency words were more dispersed

in the vowel space than those of their high-frequency
counterparts. If suprasegmental production is inﬂuenced
by lexical factors in similar ways to segmental production,
we might expect some similar adjustments in the acoustic
tone space of a tonal language when low-frequency words
are produced.
By contrast, there is no evidence from segmental
research that Lombard speech leads to more dispersed or
contrastive vowels. Lombard or shouted speech does show
changes in the vowel space, but the resulting space is not
necessarily expanded, and it also shows huge individual
differences in the direction and the degree of the shifts
(Summers et al., 1988). Indeed, in some cases, due to the
shifting of the formant frequencies, loud speech is less
intelligible and harder to understand (Rostolland, 1982).
This suggests that in the Lombard articulation of lexical
tones, we would not expect an expansion of tone space,
despite the overall increase in f0.
If there are indeed expansions in tone space for lowfrequency words, we might also expect to see differences
between male and female speakers. Cross-linguistically,
females make use of a larger acoustic space than male
speakers, including pitch range as well as vowel space (e.g.
Diehl, Lindblom, Hoemeke, & Fahey, 1996; Henton,
1995). We will therefore also look at possible gender
differences in tone space.
In this section we investigate these issues by proposing a
measure of tone space and its dispersion, and investigating
the consequences of raised f0 on phonemic contrast within
the tone inventory.
4.2. Method
A natural way of deﬁning tone space is to draw on
previous work on vowel-space. Models of vowel-space
dispersion are based on the mean Euclidean distance from
the center of the participants’ F1/F2 space (see. e.g.,
Bradlow, Torretta, & Pisoni, 1996; Munson, 2007; Wright,
2003). This metric for vowel dispersion is correlated with
word frequency: Munson and Solomon (2004) found that
vowels in high-frequency words were less expanded than
those in low-frequency words (M ¼ 2.822 Bark for highfrequency words; M ¼ 2.940 Bark for low-frequency
words).
This same intuition seems applicable to tone as well. The
closer tone productions are to the center of the acoustic f0
space, the less salient the acoustic difference between them,
and the less distinctive each tone becomes. Thus if lexical
frequency affects production in the tone domain as well, we
would predict more tone-space dispersion of low-frequency
words than of the high-frequency words.
We propose to measure tone-space dispersion as the
mean Euclidean distance of individual tones from the
center of the speakers’ f0 space (acoustic tone space).
How should we measure the center of the speakers’ f0
space, given that we have multiple estimates of f0 across the
trajectory of a word? One option is to compare the f0 value

ARTICLE IN PRESS
Y. Zhao, D. Jurafsky / Journal of Phonetics 37 (2009) 231–247

at each of the 10 points with a single global f0 mean. But
changes in the tone space may not happen homogeneously
across the tonal trajectory of a word. For this reason,
rather than keeping a single global value for the center of
the speaker’s tone space, we will compare tone values at
each of the 10 points along the trajectory with the speakers’
mean computed just for that point.
We thus deﬁne the central f0 at each time point k, CF0k
as the mean f0 a speaker uses for the time point k along the
f0 trajectory, averaged across words. That is, for each of
the ten equidistant points along the trajectory for every
word, we compute CF0k, the central f0 at the time point k,
as the average over all words j spoken by the speaker of
f 0ik , the f0 value of word i at k:
1X i
f0
j i¼1 k
j

CF 0k ¼

(1)

Given this mean value, we compute the tonal distance in
semitones (st) between an f0 value of a particular word i at
time point k and the central f0 at k as follows:


i 

log f 0k

In this study, we measured f0 at ten time points over a
number of items. Therefore to obtain the averaged tonal
distance from a tonal trajectory to the speaker’s central f0,
we need to get the mean of TDCF0 across all ten time
points over all items, as shown by the following:

We then used the measure of the tonal dispersion to
investigate whether hyperarticulation in tones incurred an
adjustment in the degrees of tonal dispersion as well.
4.3. Results
4.3.1. Tone space of Cantonese
In order to examine quantitatively whether or not
Cantonese speakers make use of a reconﬁgured tone space
when producing hyperarticulated tones, we ﬁrst calculated
the tonal centroids used in the production of highfrequency and low-frequency words respectively, and in
Lombard and normal conditions.
Fig. 4 shows the f0 trajectories of six tones in the normal
and Lombard conditions, each shown with the position of
central f0. We can see once again that all tones have higher
f0 when produced under noise. However, the distance
between each individual tone and the tonal centroid does
not change in any obvious way. Thus while noise leads to
higher f0, it does not seem to lead to more dispersion or
contrast among tones.
Fig. 5 shows the tone trajectories of both high-frequency
and low-frequency words together with the central f0 of the
tone space. Unlike the lack of effect we saw with noise,

239

with usage frequency we do see a change in tonal distance:
the distance of tones 3, 4, and 6, respective to the tonal
centroid is greater in low-frequency words than highfrequency words. The relative positioning of all tones in the
tone space also undergoes visible changes when the tones
are realized on low-frequency words, as shown in Fig. 6.
Level and falling tones are more spread out from each
other and the relative distance among tones 1, 3, 4, and 6
increases; the rising tones’ f0 maxima are also higher in
low-frequency words.
Tone-space dispersion was calculated according to
Eq. (3) above. A Repeated Measures ANOVA was used to
check whether speaking condition (normal vs. Lombard),
lexical frequency category of the word (high vs. low), tone
type and gender had a signiﬁcant inﬂuence on the degree of
dispersion in tone space. The result showed that tone type
and the usage frequency of a word had signiﬁcant main
effects on tone-space dispersion (Ftone_type(5,25) ¼ 20.877,
po.000; Flexical_frequency(1,5) ¼ 13.376, po.015). Speakers
used a more dispersed tone space when producing lowfrequency words than high-frequency ones (MD ¼ .417 st).
Unlike lexical frequency, speaking condition was found to
have no signiﬁcant effect on the adjustment of tone space
Fspeaking_condition(1,5) ¼ .278, p ¼ .620), which indicated
that speakers did not use a more dispersed tone space
when speaking in the presence of noise.
There was a signiﬁcant interaction between tone type
and lexical frequency (F(5,25) ¼ 5.273, po.002), visible in
Fig. 5. Post-hoc Bonforroni tests indicated that lexical
frequency had a signiﬁcant effect on the dispersion of (midlevel) tone 3 (F(1,7) ¼ 24.319, po.002), tone 4
(F(1,7) ¼ 23.296, po.002) and tone 6 (F(1,7) ¼ 9.304,
po.019). Low-frequency tone 3’s f0 trajectories
(M ¼ 2.073) were more dispersed from the tonal centroid
than those of high-frequency tone 3 words (M ¼ 0.926).
The f0 trajectories of low-frequency words with (lowfalling) tone 4 f0 trajectories (M ¼ 3.123) were more
dispersed than those of high-frequency tone 4 words
(M ¼ 2.73); and low-frequency tone 6 (low-level) words
(M ¼ 2.24) were more dispersed than high-frequency tone
6 words (M ¼ 1.53) from the tonal centroid. The direction
of the dispersion was relative to the position of the centroid
as shown in Fig. 5: (mid-level) tone 3 moved up and away
from the center, (low-falling) tone 4 and (low-level) tone 6
moved down and away from the center. As a result, the
relative tonal distance among tones 3, 4, and 6 increased in
low-frequency words, as can be seen in Fig. 7. Therefore,
the change in the degree of the dispersion from the tonal
centroid seems to focus on the mid–low range of the tone
space and varies by tone type.
Fig. 8 shows the tone-space dispersion for each speaker
when producing high-frequency and low-frequency words.
This suggests that all individual speakers showed some
degree of dispersion.
Though all speakers displayed tone-space dispersion,
gender had a signiﬁcant effect on the degree of the
dispersion (Fgender(1,5) ¼ 6.129, po.056). Females tended

both high-frequency and low-frequency words across
speaking conditions (MD ¼ .411 st), as shown in Fig. 9.
4.3.2. An alternative measure of dispersion for dynamic
tones
The previous section showed that only three tones
showed evidence for dispersion: (mid-level) tone 3, (lowfalling) tone 4, and (low-level) tone 6. No dispersion was
found for the two rising tones, (high-rising) tone 2 and
(low-rising) tone 5. We considered the possibility that

dispersion in dynamic tones like these rising tones might be
realized through an increase in slope, i.e., by lowering the
f0 min and raising the f0 max. This kind of dispersion
might not have been captured by our previous metric, since
stretching the endpoints might not change the average
distance to the tonal centroid. In order to rule out this
possibility, we calculated the f0 range (the f0 differences
between highest f0 point and lowest f0 point along the tone
trajectory) for (high-rising) tone 2, and (low-rising) 5, as
well as (low-falling) tone 4, to see whether any dispersion
appears by this metric.

Fig. 5. f0 trajectories of six tones relative to tonal centroids for high-frequency and low-frequency words averaged across speakers.

A Repeated Measures ANOVA was used to check
whether speech style (normal vs. Lombard), lexical
frequency category of the word (high vs. low), and tone
type had a signiﬁcant inﬂuence on the dispersion measured
by the f0 range. The result showed no signiﬁcant main
effects for either speech style (p ¼ .615), nor usage
frequency (p ¼ .617) or interaction between those factors.
Tonal dispersion therefore did not target the ‘‘range’’ of the
dynamic tones.

4.4. Interim discussion
The results on tone-space dispersion suggest that when
producing low-frequency words, speakers do tend to use a
somewhat adjusted tone space. Dispersion indices show
that the reconﬁgured tone space is more dispersed in the
mid–low range when low-frequency words are produced.
On the other hand, noise does not seem to have the same
effect on the speakers’ tone space. In Lombard speech, f0 is

raised universally for all six tones, but this rise does not
cause a reconﬁguration of the space. Of course the fact that
the tone space is more dispersed for low-frequency words
does not prove that dispersion is the causal factor in the
change of a tone’s phonetic realization in low-frequency
words. We have merely shown that dispersion is a plausible
candidate.
We also found that female speakers make use of a larger
acoustic tone space. This is consistent with previous
ﬁndings on females using a larger pitch range and vowel
space than male speakers (Diehl et al., 1996).

compared to the same tone produced without noise. We
also found an effect of usage frequency: some (mid-ranged)
tones have higher f0 in low-frequency words than in highfrequency words. Lexical frequency and Lombard effect
therefore join the wide range of other factors that are
known to inﬂuence tonal variation, such as the assimilatory
or dissimilatory contextual effects of neighboring tones
(Xu, 1997, 2001). Since in our study tones were elicited in
isolation, those effects are above and beyond any such
contextual effects.
In addition, we found that while the Lombard reﬂex
affects all tones equally, usage frequency did not. Two
mid–low tones (mid-level tone 3 and low-rising tone 5)

were signiﬁcantly affected by usage frequency, while others
were not.
One possible explanation for this difference lies in two
distinct functional roles of f0; to increase phonetic strength
and to increase phonemic distinction or contrast. To
operationalize this idea of distinction, we introduced a
new functional factor called tone-space dispersion. We
proposed that a speaker’s tonal productions lie in a
dynamic tone space, and that each production has a
particular tonal dispersion to the tonal centroid. We showed
that low-frequency and high-frequency words behaved
differently with respect to tone space: low-frequency words
were produced with a generally more dispersed tone space
than high-frequency words. In particular, mid–low tones
(mid-level tone 3, low-falling tone 4, low-level tone 6) were
more dispersed from the tonal centroid than their highfrequency counterparts. The fact that the Lombard effect
did not result in an increase in tone-space dispersion,
instead raising all six tones across-the-board, suggests that
for noise, increasing the phonetic strength of individual
tones may be a more relevant functional factor than
increasing the phonemic contrast among the tones.
5.2. Discussion
This study suggests that different sources of tonal
hyperarticulation lead to different consequences for phonetic forms. Hyperarticulation due to ambient noise is
phonetic in nature, causing universal raising of f0 in all
tones, while hyperarticulation due to lexical factors such as
usage frequency targets phonemic contrasts and only

243

affects a subset of the tone inventory. For low-frequency
words, two tones are higher (mid-level tone 3 and midrising tone 5), which moves up the tonal centroid of the
tone space, causing mid–low tones such as low-frequency
mid-level tone 3, low-falling tone 4 and low-level tone 6 to
be more dispersed from the center of the tone space.
Why did dispersion only affect these three tones and not
all six? Partial inﬂuences are not unheard of: a partial
inﬂuence of lexical frequency has also been found for vowel
production by Wright (2003), who found that frequency or
neighborhood density did not affect every vowel. In his
study it was the point vowels that were affected by
frequency, stretched out from the vowel space center as a
way of maximizing perceptual distinctiveness within the
vowel space. While it is thus plausible that only part of the
tonemic inventory in Cantonese would be subject to lexical
inﬂuence, it is important to understand why the effect is
limited to the mid-tones in particular. In the next few
paragraphs, we sketch a potential explanation; deciding if
this is indeed a causal factor would of course require
further investigation.
One potential functional explanation from the perceptual perspective is that the Cantonese mid–low tones are
more perceptually confusable with each other than are
other Cantonese tones. We know that, in natural production, the variations of the mid–low level tones overlap
greatly with each other. Previous work on Cantonese tone
production suggests that in fact the average f0 of (midlevel) tone 3 does not signiﬁcantly differ from the average
f0 of (low-level) tone 6 (Whitehill, Ciocca, & Chow, 2000).
The proximity of mid–low tones in the production f0 space
results in a high confusion rate in perception. Vance (1977)
reported that all stimuli with low average f0 (99–120 Hz)
were perceived as tone 4. Khouw and Ciocca (2007)
showed through a perceptual study that subjects had great
difﬁculty in telling apart the mid–low tones. For instance,
(mid-level) tone 3 is often misperceived as (low-level) tone
6, and (low-falling) tone 4 as either tone 3 or tone 6. Our
results show that lexical frequency affects the conﬁguration
of those tones of high confusability in perception. Increasing
dispersion in the mid–low tones may be a way of alleviating
this perceptual confusability by increasing phonemic contrasts. By raising tones 3 and 5, the tonal centroid is raised,
and tones 3, 4, and 6 become more dispersed and further
apart from one another. The fact that tone 5 rises but does
not itself become more dispersed may be because it itself is
not confusable with the rest of the mid–low tones (tones 3, 4,
6) due to its unique rising contour.
Under this hypothesis, high tones do not expand because
they are already less confusable. Some sort of ceiling effect
may also be playing a role. Again, this possibility that the
perceptual confusability of the mid–low tones is the causal
factor is only a hypothesis, and understanding whether it is
really implicated in the effect of frequency on mid-range
tones needs to be empirically veriﬁed.
Finally, one limitation of our study is the possible
confound of function words with high-frequency words.

Due to a controversy in the classiﬁcation of function words
in Chinese (e.g., Ma, 2004), it is hard to strictly determine
whether a word is a function word or not. But according to
some classiﬁcations (e.g. Zhang, 2003), a few words in our
high-frequency stimuli can be considered ‘‘closed class’’,
such as dou1 and bei2. Since these words are spread out
across all tone categories, we think their presence is
unlikely to have been the causal factor in the rise we
found in the mid-tones. In any case, since high frequency is
so strongly correlated with function word status crosslinguistically, it remains for future work to explore these
two factors factorially (see Bell et al., 2009, for such a study
in English).
5.3. Implications for models of speech production
The fact that we see hyperarticulation in the production
of lexical tone, whether related to lexical frequency or to
Lombard speech, needs to be accounted for by any model
of lexical production.
One model of speech production that is generally
consistent with our results is the Hyperarticulation and
Hypoarticulation (H&H) model (Lindblom, 1990). The
H&H model assumes that speakers simultaneously balance
the needs of the speaker to minimize production effort and
the needs of the listener for clear articulation. Words that
might be harder for the hearer to hear, because of noise, or
to predict, because they are rarer, less contextually
predictable, or more confusable, result in more cues for
the hearer, such as longer durations, expanded vowel
space, more canonical pronunciations, and so on. More
recently, some research has offered further details of its
functional motivations. For instance, Van Son, Koopmansvan Beinum, and Pols (1998), Jurafsky et al. (2001), Van
Son and Pols (2003), Aylett (2000), and Aylett and Turk
(2004, 2006) have proposed that hyperarticulation
is related speciﬁcally to the information value (entropy)
or probability of an utterance; more probable or less
informative parts of an utterance were somehow phonetically reduced. Pan and Hirschberg (2000) showed that this
effect of information value also played its role at the
prosodic level; words that were unpredictable or had lower
frequency were more likely to be pitch accented by the
speaker.
Our results could be interpreted under these H&H-style
models, which would indeed predict hyperarticulation for
low-frequency words or words produced in noise. However, truly testing an H&H-style explanation would require
further experiments to see whether hyperarticulated tones
result in better intelligibility for the hearer. In addition, the
H&H models do not currently give a way to explain the
strengthening function of noise (raising f0 for all 6 tones),
a kind of ‘phonetic hyperarticulation’, and the contrast
function of usage frequency (increasing dispersion for
mid–low tones), a kind of ‘phonemic hyperarticulation’.
Other theorists have proposed possible production
mechanisms by which hyper- or hypoarticulation may be

implemented. With regards to the execution of prosody in
particular, Kochanski and Shih (2003) proposed a model of
prosodic strength to accommodate various functional
needs in the implementation of prosody. Aylett (2000)
and Aylett and Turk (2004) also proposed that predictability-based adjustments in articulation are mediated by
prosodic prominence structure. The information value of
parts of an utterance is used to determine prosodic
prominence, which then determines syllable and segment
duration. The models of Aylett (2000), Aylett and Turk
(2004), and Kochanski and Shih (2003) all suggest that the
prosodic realization of low-frequency words or tones
produced in degraded environments would be phonetically
strengthened due to their low a priori predictability, high
information load or the need of enhanced intelligibility in
noisy transmission channels. Each of these models is
compatible with our results that low-frequency words
and words produced under noise are strengthened in tone.
However, in order to account for the differences between
the two types of hyperarticulation and especially the
change in phonemic contrasts, further speciﬁcations of
the models are needed.
A ﬁnal possible model, due to Pierrehumbert (2002) and
Myers (pers. commun.) among others, is that highfrequency words are stored in a lenited form in their
lexical representation. An extension of Pierrehumbert’s
model to tone, assuming that lenition in tone implies lower
f0, would suggest that high-frequency words are stored
with lower f0, and that our result would be modeled as an
effect of hypoarticulation rather than hyperarticulation.
The idea that exemplars of words are stored with their
prosodic attributes has proved to be a successful model in
engineering applications like speech synthesis (Nenkova
et al., 2007; Strom et al., 2007). It is less clear how an
exemplar model like Pierrehumbert’s would predict the
differences we see in the effect of usage frequency on
tone, or the adjustment of tone space, but perhaps the
model could be extended with some notion of phonemic
space.
In summary, whether hyperarticulation in tone production is due to prosodic strengthening, due to perceptual
factors, due to their inﬂuence on long-term representation
of exemplars, or due to some combination of these remains
an important open question. Our study nevertheless
shows important basic results on lexical production in
tone languages that these models must account for, and
offers suggestive evidence that extends previous work
showing speakers’ manipulation of production space
to accommodate functional needs. To continue this
line of research, future studies will need to investigate
further lexical factors, such as phonological neighborhood
density, to see if neighborhood effects inﬂuence tone
production and whether they are sensitive to the phonemic
contrasts of lexical tones. In addition, an important goal
is the development of a uniﬁed production model that
can account for strength-oriented ‘‘phonetic hyperarticulation’’ effects due to Lombard reﬂex as well as the
