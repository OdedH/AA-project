Probabilistic Relations between Words: Evidence
from Reduction in Lexical Production

1 Introduction
The ideas of frequency and predictability have played a fundamental role in models of human language processing for well over a hundred years (Schuchardt,
1885; Jespersen, 1922; Zipf, 1929; Martinet, 1960; Oldﬁeld & Wingﬁeld, 1965;
Fidelholz, 1975; Jescheniak & Levelt, 1994; Bybee, 1996). While most psycholinguistic models have thus long included word frequency as a component,
recent models have proposed more generally that probabilistic information about
words, phrases, and other linguistic structure is represented in the minds of language users and plays a role in language comprehension (Jurafsky, 1996; MacDonald, 1993; McRae, Spivey-Knowlton, & Tanenhaus, 1998; Narayanan & Jurafsky, 1998; Trueswell & Tanenhaus, 1994) production (Gregory, Raymond, Bell,
Fosler-Lussier, & Jurafsky, 1999; Roland & Jurafsky, 2000) and learning (Brent &
Cartwright, 1996; Landauer & Dumais, 1997; Saffran, Aslin, & Newport, 1996;
Seidenberg & MacDonald, 1999).
In recent papers (Bell, Jurafsky, Fosler-Lussier, Girand, & Gildea, 1999; Gregory et al., 1999; Jurafsky, Bell, Fosler-Lussier, Girand, & Raymond, 1998), we
have been studying the role of predictability and frequency in lexical production.
Our goal is to understand the many factors that affect production variability as reﬂected in reduction processes such as vowel reduction, durational shortening, or
ﬁnal segmental deletion of words in spontaneous speech. One proposal that has
resulted from this work is the Probabilistic Reduction Hypothesis: word forms are
reduced when they have a higher probability. The probability of a word is conditioned on many aspects of its context, including neighboring words, syntactic and
lexical structure, semantic expectations, and discourse factors. This proposal thus
generalizes over earlier models which refer only to word frequency (Zipf, 1929;
Fidelholz, 1975; Rhodes, 1992, 1996) or predictability (Fowler & Housum, 1987).
In this paper we focus on a particular domain of probabilistic linguistic knowledge in lexical production: the role of local probabilistic relations between words.
1

Our previous research as well as research by others (Bush, 1999; Bybee & Scheibman, 1999; Krug, 1998) suggests that words which are strongly related to or predictable from neighboring words, such as collocations (sequences of commonly
cooccurring words), are more likely to be phonologically reduced.
This paper extends our earlier studies of reduction, arguing that these probabilistic relations between words should be interpreted as evidence for emergent
linguistic structure, and more speciﬁcally as evidence that probabilistic relations
between words are represented in the mind of the speaker. Testing the claim requires showing that probabilistic relations are represented very generally across
words. We therefore examine probabilistic relations with function words as well as
with content words, with frequent words as well as with infrequent words. It is also
crucial to understand the exact nature of these probabilistic effects. We thus study
various probabilistic measures of a word’s predictability from neighboring words,
and test the effects of each on various types of reduction. Our conclusions support
the probabilistic reduction hypothesis; more probable words are more likely to be
reduced. The results suggest that probabilistic relations between words must play
a role in the mental representation of language.
Our experiments are based on two distinct datasets, each drawn from 38,000
words that were phonetically hand-transcribed from American English telephone
conversations (Greenberg, Ellis, & Hollenback, 1996). The ﬁrst dataset consists
of 5618 of the 9000 tokens of the 10 most frequent function words: I, and, the,
that, a, you, to, of, it, and in. The second focuses on 2042 of the 3000 content
word tokens whose lexical form ends in a t or d. Each observation is coded with
its duration and pronunciation as well as contextual factors such as the local rate of
speech, surrounding segmental context and nearby disﬂuencies. We use linear and
logistic regression to control for contextual factors and study the extent to which
various probabilistic measures of lexical predictability account for reduction of
word forms, as indicated by vowel reduction, deletion of ﬁnal t or d, and durational
shortening. Throughout this paper we will use the term ‘reduced’ to refer to forms
that have undergone any of these processes.

Measures of Probabilistic Relations between Words

The Probabilistic Reduction Hypothesis claims that words are more reduced when
they are more predictable or probable. There are many ways to measure the probability of a word. This section discusses a number of local measures that we have
studied, although we will mainly report on two measures: the conditional probability of the target word given the preceding word and the conditional probability
of the target word given the following word.
The simplest measure of word probability is called the prior probability. The
prior probability of a word is the probability without considering any contextual
2

factors (‘prior’ to seeing any other information). The prior probability is usually
estimated by using the relative frequency of the word in a sufﬁciently large corpus.
The relative frequency is the frequency of the word divided by the total number of
word tokens in the corpus:

The relative frequency is thus a normalized version of word frequency similar to information in frequency dictionaries such as Francis and Kuˇ era (1982).
c
Throughout the paper we use the term relative frequency rather than prior probability, although the reader should keep in mind that frequencies are estimates of the
probability of a word’s occurrence independent of context. We also consider the
relative frequencies of the preceding and following words.
Probability can also be measured with respect to neighboring words. We use
two measures (the joint probability and the conditional probability) of the predictability of a word given the previous word. The joint probability of two words
may be thought of as the prior probability of the two words taken together, and is estimated by just looking at the relative frequency of the two words
together in a corpus:

!§¦£ ¤¦¤£¢ 
¥  ¥ ¡

This is a variant of what Krug (1998) called the string frequency of the two words.
The conditional probability of a word given the previous word is also sometimes called the transitional probability (Bush, 1999; Saffran et al., 1996). The
conditional probability of a particular target word
given a previous word
is estimated from a sufﬁciently large corpus, by counting the number of times the
two words occur together
, and dividing by
, the number of
times that the ﬁrst word occurs:



The difference between the conditional and joint probability is that the conditional probability controls for the frequency of the conditioning word. For example, pairs of words can have a high joint probability merely because the individual
words are of high frequency (e.g., of the). The conditional probability would be
high only if the second word was particularly likely to follow the ﬁrst. Most measures of word cohesion, such as conditional probability and mutual information,
are based on such metrics which control for the frequencies of one or both of the
words (Manning & Sch¨ tze, 1999).
u

In addition to considering the preceding word, the effect of the following word
may be measured by the two corresponding probabilities. The joint probability of
a word with the next word
is estimated by the relative frequency of the
two words together:

Similarly, the conditional probability of the target word given the next word
is the probability of the target word
given the next word
. This may be
viewed as the predictability of a word given the word the speaker is about to say,
and is estimated as follows:

Finally, we mention brieﬂy four other measures that played a smaller role in
our analyses. We considered a number of trigram probability measures. Two of
these were the conditional probability of the target given the two previous words
, and the conditional probability of the target given the two fol. Neither of these turned out to predict reduction
lowing words
after we controlled for the (bigram) conditional probabilities of the previous and
following words. The conditional probability of the target given the two surrounding words is the probability of the target given one word preceding and one word
following the target
. This trigram was a signiﬁcant predictor
in some analyses. It is estimated as follows:

Table 1 contains a summary of the probabilistic measures and some examples
of high probability items from the dataset for each measure. The reader can obtain
4

some idea of the ways that these different measures of local predictability rank
word combinations in Tables 6–8 in Appendix 2.
The actual computation we used for estimating these probabilities was somewhat more complex than the simple explanations above. Since our 38,000 word
corpus was far too small to estimate word probabilities, we used the entire 2.4 million word Switchboard corpus (from which our corpus was drawn) instead. See
Jurafsky et al. (1998) for details about the backoff and discounting methods that
we used to smooth the estimates of very low frequency items. We then took the log
of these probabilities for use in our regression analyses.
In this paper we report mainly the effects of conditional probabilities. In general, however, we ﬁnd that most of the measures (conditional probability, joint
probability, various relative frequencies of words) show some effect on reduction.
Given their deﬁnitional interdependence, this is not surprising. If one wishes to
pick a single measure of probability for convenience in reporting, it makes sense to
pick one which combines several independent measures, such as mutual information (which combines the joint, the relative frequency of the target, and the relative
frequency of the neighboring word) or conditional probability (which combines
joint probability and the relative frequency of the neighboring word). We chose
conditional probability because for this particular data set it was a better single
measure than joint probability.
In Gregory et al. (1999) we considered the mutual information (Fano, 1961) of
the target word and the following word. There we showed that mutual information
produces very similar results to the conditional probability of the target word given
the following word. For this reason, and because mutual information turns out
to be an inappropriate metric for our analyses of function words,1 we report on
conditional probability rather than mutual information in this paper.
In general, the most predictive model of any data is obtained by using a combination of (independent) measures rather than one single measure. Thus, for example, in some cases we found that a combination of conditional probability, joint
probability, and relative frequency all play a role in reduction. See Appendix 1
for further discussion of the relationships between conditional probability, joint
probability, and relative frequency of the previous word.

Effects of Predictability on Function Words

Our ﬁrst experiment studied the 10 most frequent English function words in the
Switchboard corpus. (These are also the ten most frequent words in the corpus.)
1

This is because mutual information includes the relative frequency of the target word. Since
the function word analysis was based on only ten types of function words, this relative frequency
component will merely act to distinguish the ten items, rather than to represent their frequencies, as
it would with a larger sample.

3.1

The Function Word Dataset

The function word dataset was drawn from the Switchboard corpus of telephone
conversations between strangers, collected in the early 1990s (Godfrey, Holliman,
& McDaniel, 1992). The corpus contains 2430 conversations averaging 6 minutes
each, totaling 240 hours of speech and about 3 million words spoken by over 500
speakers. The corpus was collected at Texas Instruments, mostly by soliciting paid
volunteers who were connected to other volunteers via a robot telephone operator.
Conversations were then transcribed by court reporters into a word-by-word text.
Approximately four hours of speech from these conversations were phonetically hand-transcribed by students at UC Berkeley (Greenberg et al., 1996) as
follows. The speech ﬁles were automatically segmented into pseudo-utterances at
turn boundaries or at silences of 500 ms or more, and a rough automatic phonetic
transcription was generated. The transcribers were given these utterances along
with the text and rough phonetic transcriptions. They then corrected the phonetic
transcription, using an augmented version of the ARPAbet, and marked syllable
boundaries, from which durations of each syllable were computed.
The phonetically-transcribed corpus contains roughly 38,000 transcribed words
(tokens). The function word dataset consists of all instances of the 10 most frequent
English function words: I, and, the, that, a, you, to, of, it , and in. This subcorpus
contained about 9,000 word tokens. Our analyses are based on the 5,618 tokens
remaining after excluding various non-comparable items (see 3.3).
Each observation was coded for two dependent factors reﬂecting reduction:
 

vowel reduction: We coded the vowel of each function word as full or reduced.
The full vowels included basic citation or clariﬁcation pronunciations, e.g.
for the, as well as other non-reduced vowels. The reduced vowels that
occurred in the function words were

reduced-vowel pronunciations of the function-words, while Figure 1 shows
the relative proportions of each vowel type by function word.

The Regression Analysis

We used multiple regression to evaluate the effects of our predictability factors on
reduction. A regression analysis is a statistical model that predicts a response variable (in this case, the word duration, or the frequency of vowel reduction) based

In general we relied on Berkeley transcriptions for our coding, although we did do some data
cleanup, including eliminating some observations we judged likely to be in error; see Jurafsky et al.

on contributions from a number of other explanatory factors (Agresti, 1996). Thus
when we report that an effect was signiﬁcant, it is meant to be understood that it is
a signiﬁcant parameter in a model that also includes the other signiﬁcant variables.
In other words, after accounting for the effects of the other explanatory variables,
adding the explanatory variable in question produced a signiﬁcantly better account
of the variation in the response variable. For duration, which is a continuous variable, we used ordinary linear regression to model the log duration of the word. For
vowel quality, which is a categorical variable, we used logistic regression.
3.3

Control Factors

The reduction processes are each inﬂuenced by multiple structural and performance factors that must be controlled to assess the contribution of the probability
7

measures to reduction. We brieﬂy review these factors here and our method of
controlling for them. First, we excluded tokens of function words based on the
following three factors:
Planning problems: We removed function words which are immediately followed
by disﬂuencies indicative of ‘planning problems’ (pauses, ﬁlled pauses uh
and um, or repetitions), since they tend to have less-reduced pronunciations
(Fox Tree & Clark, 1997; Jurafsky et al., 1998; Bell et al., 1999; Shriberg,
1999). We also removed words that were preceded by ﬁlled pauses since
preceding pauses might affect durational patterns.
Phrase boundary position: We removed words which are initial or ﬁnal in our
pseudo-utterances. The pseudo-utterances of our datasets are bounded by
turns or long pauses, although they do include multiple intonational phrases
in some cases. Thus words which were initial or ﬁnal in our pseudo-utterances
included most words which are turn- or utterance-initial or ﬁnal. Such words
are known to have different durational patterns.
Special forms We removed cliticized function words (e.g., you’ve, I’ve, it’s) and
the variant an of the indeﬁnite article a.
We then controlled other variables known or suspected to affect reduction by
entering them ﬁrst in the regression model. Thus the base model for an analysis
was a regression on the following set of control factors:
Rate of Speech: Speech researchers have long noted the association between faster
speech, informal styles, and more reduced forms. For a recent quantitative account of rate effects in Switchboard, see Fosler-Lussier and Morgan
(1998). We measured rate of speech at a given function word by taking
the number of syllables per second in the smallest pause-bounded region
containing the word. Our regression models included both log rate and log
squared rate.
Segmental Context: A general fact about reduction processes is that the form of a
word is inﬂuenced by the segmental context—for example, consonant deletion is favored when a segment is preceded by or followed by a consonant.
We controlled for the class (consonant or vowel) of the following segment.
Syllable type of target: We coded the target word for syllable type (open or closed)
(e.g., it vs. a). This variable interacts closely with segmental context.

8

Reduction of following vowel: The prosodic pattern of the utterance plays a crucial role in reduction. Since our current dataset does not mark stress or accent, the only prosodic control was whether the vowel in the syllable following the target word was reduced or full. (This partially controls for stress
since the reduction of the following vowel should correlate with its stress
level, and hence the stress level of the target word.)
We also included a number of terms for the interactions between these variables.
Several factors that have been reported to inﬂuence reduction were not controlled in this study. First, our deﬁnition of words was quite simpliﬁed; we assume that anything bounded by spaces in the text transcriptions was a word. Thus
Supreme Court and most of were each considered two words, although we controlled for this simpliﬁcation in the experiments described in 4. Other factors not
controlled included additional aspects of the preceding segment environment (e.g.,
vowel identity and coda identity), prosodic structure (including position and metrical prominence) and social variables (register, age, gender, race, social class, etc.).
We did control for some of these social variables in our earlier work (Bell et al.,
1999) and still found robust effects of the predictability measures. Control of reduction of the following vowel and of pseudo-utterance position in our analyses
partially controls effects of prosodic structure, stress, and accent.
The fact that the 10 words in this dataset were all very frequent limited our
ability to study relative frequency. (The most common word, I, is about 3 times
more frequent than the least common word in, compared to an overall ratio of
probability of about 100,000 to 1 for the highest and lowest frequency words in
the entire corpus.) What variation there is, moreover, is inextricably confounded
with the effects of form and patterns of combination of the individual items. Since
it is consequently not possible to obtain useful inferences about the effects of relative frequency with the function words dataset, this variable is omitted from the
analyses.

Results

3.4.1 Vowel Reduction in Function Words
We ﬁrst tested the relationship between the target word and the previous word,
by adding the conditional probability of the target word given the previous word
to the regression equation after a base model that included the control variables. Predictability from the previous word was a signiﬁcant predictor of
reduction (
). The higher the conditional probability of the target given
the previous word, the greater the expected likelihood of vowel reduction in the
function word target.

The predicted likelihood of a reduced vowel in words which were highly predictable from the preceding word (at the 95th percentile of conditional probability)
was 48 percent, whereas the likelihood of a reduced vowel in low predictability
words (at the 5th percentile) was 24 percent.
Reduction of the target word is also affected by its probabilistic relations with

The predicted likelihood of a reduced vowel in words which were highly predictable from the following word (at the 95th percentile of conditional probability)

words (at the 5th percentile) was 35 percent. Note that the magnitude of the effect
was a good deal weaker than that with the previous word.

We found similar effects of predictability on function word duration. The conditional probability of the target word given the previous word

High conditional probability tokens (at the 95th percentile of the conditional probability) have a predicted duration of 92 ms; low conditional probability tokens (at
the 5th percentile) have a predicted duration of 118 ms.
A similar effect on shortening was found for the relationship of the target word

predicted duration of 123 ms.
As with vowel reduction, there is a small additional signiﬁcant effect of the
preceding and following words together, as measured by the conditional probability
given the two surrounding words (

Independence of Duration and Vowel Reduction

The fact that the vowels in function words are reduced when the words are more
predictable could be modeled as a categorical, non-gradient effect. That is, based
on predictability, speakers could be making some sort of categorical choice in lexical production between two possible vowels, one full and one reduced. But the
results on durational shortening cannot be modeled categorically. The effect of
predictability on shortening is a gradient, non-categorical one.
It is possible, however, that the shortening effects that we observe for function
words might be solely a consequence of the vowel reduction effects, since reduced
vowels are indeed durationally shorter than full vowels. If shortening was only a
consequence of vowel selection, there might be no evidence for a gradient effect
of probability on reduction. In order to test whether the effects of probability on
shortening were completely due to vowel reduction, we added a variable to the base
model for duration that coded whether the function word’s vowel was reduced or
full.
We found that all the probabilistic variables remain robustly signiﬁcant predictors of duration, even after controlling for vowel reduction. That is, predictability
not only affects vowel reduction, but has an additional independent non-categorical
effect on word duration.
As further conﬁrmation, we looked at the full and reduced vowels separately
to see whether the shortening effects occurred in words with full vowels as well
as words with reduced vowels. Indeed, higher probability predicted durational
shortening both in the words with full vowels and words with reduced vowels.
For words with full vowels and words with reduced vowels, those that had higher
conditional probabilities (given either the previous or following word) were signif).
icantly shorter than those with lower conditional probabilities (
These results conﬁrm that there is an effect of predictability on reduction that
is continuous and not purely categorical, suggesting that the domain of applicability of the Probabilistic Reduction Hypothesis includes linguistic levels that allow
continuous phenomena.3

The Function Word Dataset: Discussion

The results for the function word dataset show that function words that are more
predictable are shorter and more likely to have reduced vowels, supporting the
3

In order to ensure that the durational effects have some continuous component, we would also
need to control for presence or absence of consonants. While we couldn’t do a full analysis here, we
did examine the durations of a subset of 2878 items in which all consonants were present. Even after
controlling for these categorical factors (vowel quality and consonant presence), target words were
still shorter when they had a high conditional probability given the following word, or a high joint
probability with the previous word.

11

Probabilistic Reduction Hypothesis. The conditional probability of the target word
given the preceding word and given the following one both play a role, on both
duration and deletion. The magnitudes of the duration effects are fairly substantial,
in the order of 20 ms or more, or about 20 percent, over the range of the conditional
probabilities (excluding the highest and lowest ﬁve percent of the items).
The fact that there are effects of predictability on duration in addition to the
effects on vowel reduction, and that they affect both full and reduced vowels, suggests that some of the effects of predictability on reduction are continuous and
non-categorical. Under one possible model of these effects, the categorical vowel
reduction effects could be the result of lexicalization or grammaticalization leading to segmental changes in the lexicon or grammar, while the continuous duration
effects are on-line effects, perhaps mediated in part by prosodic structure, but not
represented in lexicalized differences. Our results do not allow us to make any conclusions about such a possible model. Indeed, while our results, like many results
on variation phenomena, could arise from two qualitatively different processes,
one applying more generally across items and processes and one the result of lexicalizations and grammaticalizations, these need not map cleanly into categorical
and non-categorical reductions. At least some vowel reduction may be gradient,
and it is conceivable that some of the duration effects demonstrated above could
arise from lexicalization. Thus the actual delineation of a model of the effects of
predictability on reduction remains to be done.

Lexical versus Collocation Effects

So far we have shown that the conditional probability of a function word given the
surrounding words is a signiﬁcant predictor of reduced vowels and shorter durations. Shortening effects seems to provide strong evidence that probabilistic links
between words are represented in the mind of the speaker.
But an examination of the high probability word pairs in Tables 6–8 (Appendix
2) raises a potential problem. Many of these pairs (like sort of or kind of) might
be single lexical items rather than word pairs (sorta, kinda). This classiﬁcation as
high-probability word pairs would then stem from the fact that we rely on a purely
orthographic deﬁnition of a word (i.e., words are separated by white space). Perhaps our results concerning the effect of predictability on reduction are merely facts
about such recently emergent words like sorta, and not facts about probabilistic relations between words that are accessed separately. That is, perhaps our results are
purely lexical rather than syntactic (e.g., word-order) facts about reduction.
In order to test this hypothesis, it is necessary to show that higher predictability is associated with increased reduction even in word combinations that are not
lexicalized. Based on the intuitions that many pairs of words with high conditional
probability may be lexicalized (see the top half of Tables 7 or 8) and word pairs
12

with low conditional probabilities are likely not (see the bottom half of Tables 7 or
8), we split the function word observations into two groups of high and low conditional probabilities. Table 3 shows the 10 sequences with the highest conditional
probabilities from the lower half of the range. Looking at these tables, these words
are less likely to be lexically combined with their neighbors, and yet their duration is still affected by both the conditional probability given the preceding and the
conditional probability given the following word. The higher the probability of the
word given its neighbor, the shorter the word.
Table 3: The 10 most probable function word sequences in context from the lower
half of the probability range, according to two probability measures. Function
words in this lower range did show effects of durational shortening due to higher
probability.

For each of these groups, we tested the effects of conditional probability given
the previous word on both vowel reduction and durational shortening. Each test
was then repeated for the conditional probability given the following word. Since
lexicalized sequences of words should have high conditional probabilities, if the
effects we ﬁnd are limited to lexicalizations, we should ﬁnd that our effects only
hold for the upper halves of the conditional probabilities.
Considering ﬁrst the effects of the preceding word, we found that there was no
signiﬁcant effect of conditional probability on vowel reduction in the low group,
but there was a signiﬁcant effect of conditional probability in the high group. These
results lend some support for the inﬂuence of lexicalization. For duration, however, conditional probability of the preceding word had a signiﬁcant effect for both
groups, although it did appear to be somewhat stronger for the high group.
The results for following word effects did not support the lexicalization hypoth13

esis. Conditional probability of the following word was just as good a predictor of
vowel reduction in the low probability group as in the high probability group.
We were surprised to ﬁnd that the duration of tokens in the high group was
not affected by conditional probability given the following word, even though durations in the low group were shorter for higher conditional probabilities. This
suggests that there may be a ceiling that limits its effect on duration.
While these results are preliminary, and invite further analysis, they suggest
two conclusions. First, more predictable words are more reduced even if they are
in a low probability group and unlikely to be lexically combined with a neighboring word. Thus we ﬁnd clear evidence for probabilistic relations between words.
Second, particularly for the predictability from the previous word, the high group
shows a stronger effect of predictability on reduction. This suggests that there is
some reduction in duration may be due to the lexicalization of word pairs.

Effects of Predictability on Final-t/d Content Words

Our previous results show that function words which are very predictable from
neighboring words (i.e., have high conditional probability given the previous or
following word) are more reduced. Even though these results show that probabilistic relations hold over the full range of predictabilities for function words, it
is possible that they would not hold for content words. This might be true, for
example, if function words are more likely to cliticize, lexicalize, or collocate with
neighboring words than content words, or if probabilistic relations between words
were to only apply at the higher ranges of predictability that are more typical of
function words. Because content words have a much wider range of frequencies
than function words, they also allow us to investigate the role of target word frequency. We therefore turn to content words to see if they are also reduced when
they are more probable.
5.1

The Final-t/d Content Word Dataset

The Final-t/d Content Word dataset is again drawn from the 38,000 word phoneticallytranscribed Switchboard database. (See 3.1 for details.) The database contained
about 3000 content words ending in t or d. Eliminating observations to control for
factors discussed below left 2042 word tokens in our analyses. Table 4 shows some
common examples, together with frequencies per million words from the entire 2.4
million word Switchboard corpus.
Each observation was coded for two dependent reduction factors:4

Our earlier work also considered other reduction factors; see Jurafsky et al. (1998) for our results
on deletion of coda obstruents in function words (it, that, and, of) and Gregory et al. (1999) on
tapping in ﬁnal-t/d words.

Deletion of ﬁnal consonant: Final t-d deletion is deﬁned as the absence of a pronounced oral stop segment corresponding to a ﬁnal t or d in words. A ﬁnal t
or d was coded as deleted if in the Greenberg et al. (1996) transcription the
t or d was not transcribed as phonetically realized. For example, the phrase
‘but the’ was often pronounced
in the dataset, with no segment corresponding to the t in but. Table 5 shows examples of full and t/d-deleted
forms.

Control Factors

As with the function word analyses, we excluded tokens of words which occurred
in disﬂuent contexts, or initially or ﬁnally in pseudo-utterances. We also excluded
15

polysyllabic words from the duration analyses to make the items more comparable.
Other factors were controlled by including them in the regression model before
considering the predictability factors. They included variables already discussed—
rate of speech, rate of speech squared, whether the next vowel was reduced or not,
following segment type (consonant or vowel), and whether the word coda included
a consonant cluster. The base model also included the following additional factors:
Inﬂectional status: Fasold (1972), Labov (1972), Bybee (1996) and others noted
that a ﬁnal t or d which functions as a past tense morpheme (e.g., missed or
kept) is less likely to be deleted than a t or d which is not (e.g. mist).
Identity of the underlying segment: We coded the identity of the underlying ﬁnal segment (t or d).
Number of syllables: The number of syllables in the word is of course correlated
with both word frequency and word duration (for the deletion analysis only,
since the duration analysis was limited to monosyllabic words).
5.3

Results

Using multiple regression, the predictability measures were tested on the two shortening variables of deletion and duration by adding them to each of the regression
models after the base model. Recall that in the function word experiment we did not
include the relative frequency of the target word as a factor. For the content words,
however, this factor was included. Note that while targets are content words, preceding and following words may be function words.
5.4

Duration

The duration analysis was performed on 1412 tokens of the ﬁnal-t/d content words.
We found a strong effect of the relative frequency of the target word (
). Overall, high frequency words (at the 95th percentile of frequency) were
18% shorter than low frequency words (at the 5th percentile).
The conditional probability of the target given the next word signiﬁcantly affected duration: more predictable words were shorter (
). Words with
high conditional probability (at the 95th percentile of the conditional probability
given the next word) were 12% shorter than low conditional probability words (at
the 5th percentile).
Both the conditional probability of the target given the previous word (
) and the joint probability of the target with the previous word (
)
signiﬁcantly affected duration. This instance is complicated in that no one factor
adequately represents the effects on duration.

Deletion

The deletion analysis was performed on 2042 tokens of t/d-ﬁnal content words.
Again, we found a strong effect of relative frequency (
). High frequency words (at the 95th percentile) were 2.0 times more likely to have deleted
ﬁnal t or d than the lowest frequency words (at the 5th percentile).
The conditional probability of the target given the previous word did not signiﬁcantly affect deletion. The only previous word variable that affected deletion
in target words was the relative frequency of the previous word. More frequent
previous words lead to less deletion in the target word (
).
We had found in earlier work (Gregory et al., 1999) that deletion was not sensitive to predictability effects from the following word. This result was conﬁrmed
in our current results. Neither the conditional probability of the target word given
the next word nor the relative frequency of the next word predicted deletion of ﬁnal
t or d.

Final-t/d Content Word Dataset: Discussion

Content words with higher relative frequencies (prior probabilities) are shorter and
are more likely to have deleted ﬁnal t or d than content words with lower relative
frequencies. As is the case with all of our results, this is true even after controlling
for rate of speech, number of syllables, and other factors. The effect of target word
frequency was the strongest overall factor affecting reduction of content words,
and provides support for the Probabilistic Reduction Hypothesis.
In addition to the effect of relative frequency, we also found an effect of conditional probability. Content words which have a higher conditional probability
given the following word are shorter, although not more likely to undergo ﬁnal
segment deletion.
Overall, however, the effects of conditional probability on reduction are much
weaker in content words than we saw in function words. Conditional probabilities
of the targets given either the following or the previous word had no effect on
deletion. We also found no effect of the conditional probability of the target word
given the previous word on duration. Failure to ﬁnd effects may be due to the
smaller number of observations in the content word dataset or the general lower
frequencies of content words.
The only effect of the previous word was an effect of previous-word relative
frequency. High-frequency previous words led to longer target forms and less
ﬁnal-t/d deletion. Unlike the effects of joint and conditional probabilities which
plausibly represent the predictability of the target word, the effect of previous (or
following) word frequency has no immediate interpretation. We are currently investigating two possible explanations for the role of previous-word frequency. One
possibility is based on the fact that the previous-word frequency is in the denom17

inator of the equation deﬁning the conditional probability of the word given the
previous word (Equation 3; see also Appendix 1). Perhaps the effect of previous
word frequency is really a consequence of conditional probability, but the size of
our content-word dataset is too small to see the effects of the numerator of Equation 3. This could be due to the fact that the counts for any two-word combinations
are lower than the counts for single words.
Another possibility is that the lengthening of content words after frequent previous words is a prosodic effect. For example, if the previous word is frequent, it
is less likely to be stressed or accented, which might raise the probability that the
current word is stressed or accented, and hence that it is less likely to be reduced.
Prosodic effects might also explain the asymmetric effect of surrounding words
(the preceding word played little role in ﬁnal deletion). This likely illustrates that
not all reduction processes are affected in the same way by probabilistic variables.
(Gregory et al. (1999), for example, found a different pattern for tapping of ﬁnal t
and d.) The asymmetry of this particular case is perhaps understandable from the
fact that ﬁnal deletion is a word edge effect, in the terminology of the phonological
of prosodic domains. It would be worth investigating whether such edge processes
are systematically less sensitive to the probability conditioning effects of material
across the prosodic boundary they mark.

6 Conclusion
The fundamental result of these analyses is that we ﬁnd evidence for the Probabilistic Reduction Hypothesis. In general, more probable words are reduced, whether
they are content or function words. Predictability from neighboring words played
a strong role in the high-frequency function words. The content words exhibited weaker effects of surrounding context, but strong effects of relative frequency.
Thus all of our measures of local predictability play a role in at least some reduction processes, and all the reduction processes are inﬂuenced by some predictability
measures. By showing that probabilistic factors inﬂuence lexical production, our
results also provide general support for probabilistic models of human language
processing (Jurafsky, 1996; Seidenberg & MacDonald, 1999)
Our analyses also show that predictability links between words are a key factor
in such probabilistic models. We showed, using several kinds of evidence, that the
effect of the neighboring word on reduction was not necessarily due to lexicalization. This includes evidence that the effect of predictability on reduction applies
both to content and function words, and that the effect of predictability applies both
to the higher and to the lower ranges of predictability. The fact that the shortening
effects are independent of vowel reduction also tends to support this hypothesis,
since such gradient processes are more likely at production processing levels after
lexical items have been merged into a prosodic frame.
18

This is an ongoing research effort, and we are currently extending these results
in a number of directions, including further examination of the slightly different
effects on context versus function words, use of larger and more general datasets,
and effect of other measures of collocation and predictability.

Appendix 1: Joint versus Conditional Probability
In the body of this paper we reported on the conditional probability as a measure of
word predictability. This appendix summarizes a slightly different way of looking
at conditional probability.
Recall that the conditional probability of the target word given the previous
word is estimated from two counts:

An alternative computation substitutes probabilities for the constituent counts,
since the probabilities are just the counts divided by a normalizing constant, and
the normalizing constants cancel:

Thus the conditional probability is made up of two probabilities: the joint probability with the previous word
(which may be thought of as the ‘relative
frequency of the two words occurring together’) and the relative frequency of the
previous word
. This means that instead of using the conditional probability in the regression equation to predict reduction, we can add in the two relative
frequencies instead as independent factors.
Adding in these two factors to the regression (directly after the base model, i.e.,
without the conditional probability given previous variable) showed that both play
a role in vowel reduction (
).

The regression coefﬁcient gives the weight that the regression assigned to each
factor. The negative coefﬁcient for the joint probability means that the higher the
joint, the more likely the word’s vowel is reduced. By contrast, the coefﬁcient is
positive for previous word probability. This means that a higher previous word
probability predicts less reduction. This is what we would expect from the probabilistic model, since the prior probability of the previous word is in the denominator
in Equation 8.
The difference between the analyses is that the conditional probability essentially holds the relative weights of the joint and preceding word probabilities equal,
whereas in the second analysis they are free to vary. The regression is essentially
telling us, for this set of data, that the joint probability should be weighted somewhat less heavily than the previous word’s relative frequency. We can see the relationship a different way by combining the conditional probability with the joint.

It is not a coincidence that the coefﬁcient of the conditional probability (
)
is the same magnitude as the coefﬁcient of the previous word’s relative frequency
in the ﬁrst analysis. The ﬁrst analysis gives the relative weights of the two basic
(log) probabilities. Since the weight of the relative frequency must be

in the second analysis its only expression is through the denominator of the conditional probability, the conditional probability must have a weight of
. Thus
the coefﬁcient of the joint probability (
) in this regression exactly compensates for the difference between the joint and the prior probabilities in the second
analysis (
).
These results (and similar ones for the conditional probability of the target
given the following word) suggest that the components of conditional probability
may be playing slightly different roles in reduction, and reﬂect different causes.
This is clearly an area that calls for further study.
