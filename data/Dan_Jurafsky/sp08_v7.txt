Abstract

2. Data and features used

The variability and reduction that are characteristic of talking in natural interaction make it very difﬁcult to detect prominence in conversational speech. In this paper, we present analytic studies and automatic detection results for pitch accent, as
well as on the realization of information structure phenomena
like givenness and focus. For pitch accent, our conditional random ﬁeld model combining acoustic and textual features has an
accuracy of 78%, substantially better than chance performance
of 58%. For givenness and focus, our analysis demonstrates that
even in conversational speech there are measurable differences
in acoustic properties and that an automatic detector for these
categories can perform signiﬁcantly above chance.

Our experiments use a subset of the Switchboard corpus that
had been hand-labeled with pitch accent markers [7]. 12 conversations from [7], amounting to 14,555 word tokens, had been
manually annotated with additional tags such as givenness [8]
and focus distinctions [9], features that the linguistic literature
suggests are predictive of prominence [4]. The pitch accent labels are binary (accented or unaccented). A 10-fold cross validation was performed for testing, in all the experiments.
In our work we use acoustic, lexical and part of speech
features to automatically detect prominence as associated with
pitch accent, givenness or focus. The lexical features are word
identity and accent ratio [10]. Accent ratio is an estimate of
the proportion of times a given word was accented in a training
corpus:

1. Introduction

Accent ratio(w) =

k
n

0.5

if B(k, n, 0.5) ≤ 0.05
otherwise

(1)

In natural conversation, speakers make some words and phrases
more prominent than others. These pitch accented words [1]
are perceptually more salient to the listener and are presumably
employed at least in part to draw the listener’s attention to informationally salient words. There are many attempts to characterize what it means to be salient based on different aspects
of information structure. For example words bearing pitch accent are contextually unexpected compared to non-prominent
words [2, 3]. The degree of givenness of a referent seems
also to be predictive of its prominence and speakers introduce
new items by accenting them, while deaccenting familiar or old
items [4, 5]. Finally, the focus of an utterance, semantically its
most salient part, is also predicted to be the most prominent [6].

where k is the number of times word w appeared accented in
the corpus, n is the total number of times the word w appeared,
B(k, n, 0.5) is the probability (binomial distribution) that k
successes occur out of n trials. Accent ratio was computed over
60 Switchboard conversations annotated for pitch accent [7] to
compute k and n for each word.
A variety of acoustic feature were used. We extracted the
pitch and energy contour over 10 msec intervals for each word
and computed a set of representative statistics of the raw and
speaker normalized pitch contour, duration and energy such as
mean, standard deviation, slope, etc. The set of 26 features used
in the experiments are summarized in Table 1.

We report results on the automatic detection of prominence
which explore the relationship between these three measures
of information structure and the acoustic correlates of prominence in a richly annotated corpus of conversational speech.
Conversational speech presents more complexities than read
speech (massive reductions, disﬂuencies, pauses) and consequently, presents a greater challenge for automatic detection of
prosodic structure.

3. Pitch accent detection

Our ﬁrst study employs Conditional Random Fields (CRFs)
to combine text-based and acoustic features to detect pitch accents in conversational speech. This is a well-studied area, and
our system achieves good performance. We then present two
analytical studies on a much less well-studied task: the automatic detection of information structure, speciﬁcally givenness
and focus.

There is a vast literature on predicting and detecting pitch accents. To brieﬂy summarize the most relevant studies, [11] recently showed that a maximum entropy classiﬁer using local
features (lexical, syntactic and acoustic) achieved good results
on detecting accents in read speech, [12] showed that conditional random ﬁelds (CRFs) offer a good way to capture contextual inﬂuences for accent detection on Switchboard, and [10]
showed that accent ratio was a powerful lexical feature.
We combined these three ideas to investigate the combination of a wide variety of acoustic and textual features in a conditional random ﬁeld (CRF), a graphical model that conditions
on an observation sequence [13]. While the maximum entropy
model makes a decision for each state independently of other
states, CRFs optimize over an entire sequence. Our work thus

Table 2: Pitch accent detection accuracies (in %) using a decision tree and CRF for different features.

draws on the previous use of CRFs in pitch accent detection
[12] while adding a much wide variety of rich lexical features
(including word identity and accent ratio), and acoustic features
([12] only used duration, speaking rate and pause).
We chose the sentence as the basic unit for sequence labeling. Other choices such as turn, intonation phrases or pausedelimited fragment could be explored in future work.
In order to clearly demonstrate the beneﬁt of the CRF
model, we ﬁrst use the features described in Section 2 in a simple decision tree classiﬁer that uses cues from the current token
alone. The results are presented in Table 2. For the CRF setting,
in addition to using the lexico-syntactic features described in
Section 2, we used only the most informative prosodic features
in the decision tree classiﬁer. The features were selected using an information gain metric. The most informative prosodic
features that we used in our CRF model are ling dur, f0 std,
e std, norm f0 diff, rel f0 diff and f0 slope. Interestingly, the
raw acoustic features rather than the speaker normalized ones
were the ones more helpful for the pitch accent prediction task.
Because the CRF++ toolkit that we used for our training
does not support real-valued features, we had to discretize the
acoustic features by taking their logarithm and performing uniform quantization. The duration feature was quantized into
5 bins and the other features were quantized into 10 equally
spaced bins. The results are again presented in Table 2. ±1 denotes the use of cues from the preceding and succeeding words
and ±2 denotes a window of 2 preceding and succeeding words,
respectively.
The ﬁrst implication from our results is the improvement
(1.1% relative) in moving from a standalone per-word decision
tree classiﬁer to a sequence model. The ability of the CRF to
optimize over a sequence is clearly important for the pitch detection task. Second, our results suggest that this contextual
information is not particularly long-distance. A window of one

preceding and succeeding word results in the highest classiﬁcation accuracy of 78.31%; adding more context degrades performance. One possible explanation for these results is the known
dispreferrence of speakers for accent clash, i.e. having two accented words right next to each other. The immediate context is
sufﬁcient to provide information about potential clash.
Acoustic features alone lead to good performance, indicating that despite the variability of conversational speech, prominence is marked acoustically in a systematic way. As in previous studies, the lexicalized accent ratio feature leads to very
good performance, which is only slightly improved by adding
more textual features (75.24% accuracy to 76.04%). The addition of acoustic features on the other hand improves accuracy
much more, reaching 78.31%.

4. Givenness realization and detection
The givenness of a referent plays an important role in prominence decisions [14] and in the choice of referring expression [15]: new information is more likely to be acoustically
prominent and realized using full noun phrase, while given information is reduced and often pronominalized. The annotation
we relied on is based on the givenness hierarchy of Prince [16]:
ﬁrst mentions of entities were marked as new and subsequent
mentions as old. Entities that are not previously mentioned, but
that are generally known or semantically related to other entities
in the preceding context are marked as mediated. Givenness annotation applies only to referring expressions, i.e. noun phrases
whose referent is a discourse entity. Complete details of the
annotation can be found in [8].
Is it possible to automatically distinguish between new and
old items occurring in natural conversational speech, based on
their acoustic properties? In order to answer this question, we
ﬁrst perform binary classiﬁcation, combining the mediated class
with new (new+med versus old distinction). We use a decision

tree classiﬁer for this task. CRFs are not directly applicable here
because the givenness tags are deﬁned only for certain words.
Since Old entities are systematically referred to by using a pronoun, we use part of speech distinctions (noun or pronoun) as
a competitive baseline which achieves 88.29% accuracy. The
classiﬁer based on acoustic features is less accurate (79.09%)
then the POS baseline, but still signiﬁcantly outperforms the
majority class (old) baseline, 53.98% (table 3).

Table 3: Information status detection accuracies using decision
tree for different features - old vs med+new
The results from the overall givenness classiﬁcation, even
based on acoustic features alone, are good, but they do not give
a clear indication of how different the acoustic realizations of
nouns from the three classes of givenness are. It is possible that
most of the separability of the classes comes from differences
between full nouns and pronouns. In order to examine the issue
more closely, we further investigated the differences between
nouns only. Table 4 gives the overall distribution of nouns in
givenness classes and their realization as bearing a pitch accent
or not.

Table 4: Distribution of nouns in givenness classes and presence
or absence of pitch accent
As predicted from theories of givenness, the rate of new
nouns that are prominent (bear pitch accent) is higher (and statistically signiﬁcantly so) than that for the old and mediated categories: 82% vs 73% and 78% respectively. In order to establish
differences between the givenness categories at a ﬁner acoustic
level, we performed analysis of variance with the acoustic
features as dependent variables and the givenness classes as
factors, followed by paired comparisons between each two
classes,using Tukey’s adjustment . The following acoustic individual features were signiﬁcantly different:
new-med ling dur, e mean, e mean second, e mean ﬁrst,
end nrg mean, f0 mean second, utt f0 slope.
new-old ling dur, e mean,
end nrg mean.

e mean second,

e mean ﬁrst,

Our ﬁndings are consistent with previous work [14] in
which, in a controlled experiment setting, it was found that the
most salient difference between new and old nouns is in terms
of duration. In that study amplitude was also found to be signiﬁcantly different between the two classes, while the results
for differences in fundamental frequency were weakest. Interestingly, no single acoustic feature was signiﬁcantly different
between the nouns in the old and mediated categories, suggesting that collapsing old and med classes may make more sense
in binary classiﬁcation tasks based on acoustic features.

classiﬁer combining all acoustic features, downsampled classes
with equal number of examples for each class. As the analysis

of individual acoustic features indicated, there are biggest differences between the new and mediated classes, with classiﬁcation accuracy 14% above chance level. Interestingly, while no
individual acoustic feature was signiﬁcantly different between
the med and old classes, the combination of features achieved
considerable improvement above chance performance (11%).
Our experiments with givenness distinctions show several
important facts. First, even in conversational speech, there are
measurable acoustic and prosodic differences between nouns
with different givenness status. Second, somewhat unexpectedly, nouns from the old and mediated categories are very similar to each other prosodically and acoustically, with similar accenting rates and acoustic features that distinguish them from
nouns in the new class. Finally, the combination of acoustic features can reliably distinguish among any pair of classes above
chance levels.

5. Focus realization and detection
Some entities in an utterance are particularly salient because
they are focused, i.e. contrasted with other semantically related
entities [6]. Several classes of focus were marked in the the [9]
corpus that we used: adverbial (when a focus-inducing particle
such as “only” or “just” is used), contrastive (direct comparison
of two lexical items), subset (two entities with common supertype are mentioned), and other (all other cases where the annotator perceived in item as being emphasized by the speaker but
not falling in the previous categories). Entities that did not fall
in any of the focus classes were annotated as background. Both
transcripts and audio recordings were available to the annotators. A complete description of the annotation guidelines can
be found in [9]. In a ﬁrst examination of the data, [17] showed
that sophisticated syntactic features as well as prosodic features
were indeed correlated with focus. Our goal was to extend this
preliminary work to understand what prosodic and acoustic differences exist between the focus classes and background items
in natural conversational speech. Table 6 gives the distribution
of three part of speech classes (nouns, adjectives and function
words) in the respective focus and pitch accent classes. The
table reveals that focus classes are indeed prosodically different from background items, with focus items being much more
likely to bear a pitch accent. This tendency is consistent for all
part of speech classes: nouns and adjectives tend to be accented
even in the background case, but the rate of accenting increases
when the item is focus. For function words, which typically do
not bear pitch accent, the rate of accenting doubles when the
words are marked as focus.
We again identiﬁed the acoustic features signiﬁcantly different between pairs of classes using analysis of variance followed by Tukey’s honest signiﬁcant difference paired comparison tests. The different focus classes vary acoustically from
background items in different ways:

Decision tree classiﬁer accuracies for balanced classes of
focus types versus background are shown in Table 7. As indicated by the individual feature analysis, the focus classes are not
that homogeneous and different acoustic characteristics distinguish them form the background class. For adverbial and other
focus classes which the ones mostly discussed in linguistic literature [6, 18] as associated with special prosodic realization,
acoustic features perform much better than a baseline based on
part of speech, with about 10% absolute improvement. This is
not the case for the other focus classes and speciﬁcally for the
general focus class (in which focus subtypes are merged into a
single category), the POS baseline in fact performs better than
the classiﬁer based on acoustic features. These results indicate
that while for all focus classes detection based on acoustic features is possible above baseline levels, the adverbial and other
classes are acoustically most distinct from background elements
and future studies could concentrate on only these two classes.

6. Conclusions
We have presented a study of prominence in conversational
speech, as realized via pitch accents, givenness and focus. With
a CRF based sequence model of pitch accent, we achieve a detection accuracy of 78.31%. This result is better in comparison
with the non-sequence model (decision tree) results.
We also investigated how linguistic theories of prominence
described through givenness and focus are correlated with pitch
accents and presented preliminary results on their automatic
detection. Our experiments suggest that there are measurable
acoustic differences between old and new entities and such a
distinction can be helpful in detecting prominence. Statistical
signiﬁcance tests with prosodic features demonstrated that collapsing mediated class with old is more appropriate in binary
classiﬁcation of givenness. The prosodic features utilized in
this paper also perform better than chance levels for focus classiﬁcation, outperforming the part of speech baseline for given
types of focus environments.
