ABSTRACT
Previous research has identified robust effects on
segmental production of lexical factors like word
frequency, predictability or neighborhood density.
One question that remains unanswered is whether
such lexical effects hold also at the suprasegmental
level. This study investigates whether lexical
factors such as usage frequency affect tone
production in Cantonese. We recorded Cantonese
monosyllabic words of high and low usage
frequency, controlling for segmental factors. The
results show that lexical factors do influence
suprasegmental production. Words of the same
tone but of different usage frequency differ
significantly in pitch height. Low-frequency words
are hyperarticulated and produced with relatively
higher pitch. The overall tone space of lowfrequency words is more expanded than that of
their high-frequency counterparts.
Keywords: word frequency, tone production, tonal
distance, tone space, Cantonese, Chinese
1. INTRODUCTION
Understanding the causes of variation in the
surface form of words is crucial to building models
of spoken word production. Many such causes of
variation have received extensive study, such as
the effect of the phonetic context or intonational
structure on the realization of phones. While much
is thus known about the roles of, e.g.,
coarticulation or metrical structure on variation,
less attention has historically been paid to factors
at the level of the word. Recent studies, however,
have shown that lexical factors such as word
frequency, word predictability, or neighborhood
density play an important role in the way a word is
realized. Fidelholtz [3], for example, showed that
high-frequency (HF) words like forget were more
likely to have a schwa vowel in the first syllable
than low-frequency (LF) words like forfend.
Recent studies have also found similar effects in
natural spoken corpora. Bybee [2] showed that
word-final /t/ and /d/ deletion rates in a corpus of
spoken Chicano English were higher in HF words

than in LF words. Jurafsky [4] confirmed this
higher rate of final /t/ and /d/ deletion for HF
words in a corpus of American English telephone
conversation. They also found that LF words were
longer than HF words. Finally, Munson [6] found
that LF words had an expanded vowel space
compared to HF words (the distance in F1/F2
space of the vowel from a speaker’s centroid).
The fact that HF words are more reduced or
lenited than LF words has been used to argue for
the H&H model [5] or other probabilistic reduction
models [4]. These models predict the reduction of
HF words at any level of phonetic realization,
including the suprasegmental, but this hypothetical
impact of frequency on tones has never been
tested.
In this study we therefore offer a preliminary
investigation of whether lexical factors influence
tone production, beginning with this question:
(1)

Do speakers use different f0 for LF and
HF words (of the same lexical tone)?

In addition, it is possible that there is a tonal
analog to the speaker’s vowel space, a kind of tone
space that indicates how distinct each lexical tone
is from each other. Frequency may affect this tone
space just as it affects vowel space, motivating our
second question:
(2)

Do speakers make use of an expanded
tone space when producing LF words?
2. METHOD

2.1.

Overview of methodology

We tested these hypotheses by recording a set of
isolated HF and LF monosyllabic words in
Cantonese, a 6-toned language. We examined the
f0 of each word, testing whether speakers used
different f0 values for LF and HF words. We then
defined the tone space of a speaker, as the average
distance of each word to the speaker’s tonal
centroid. We asked whether LF words were
produced with an expanded tone space.

Test language

Cantonese has six contrastive tones, three level
tones that contrast in pitch height (high-level, midlevel and low-level), two rising tones (high-rise
and low-rise), that differ in the final pitch target,
and a low-falling tone. There are three additional
checked tones, i.e. syllables ended with unreleased
stops, which mainly differ with the unchecked
tones in duration, and hence were not included in
the study. Figure 1 shows a schematic
representation of the Cantonese tone inventory:

The sound was recorded with a Panasonic
Professional DAT recorder at a sampling
frequency of 44.1K and transferred to a computer
using the software Audacity. The data were later
analyzed with PRAAT [1].
In order to capture as much tonal information
as possible, the f0 values of the tonal trajectory of
each word were measured at ten equidistant points.

Materials

The test materials include HF and LF word pairs
balanced across different tones. Word token
frequency was calculated from the Academia
Sinica’s Balanced Corpus of Modern Chinese. The
mean log frequency of HF words is 3.655 and that
of LF words is 0.969. All word pairs are
monosyllabic and in either CV or CVC structure.
The voicing and manner of the initial consonant is
consistent within each pair of high-low frequency
words. The vowel length (Cantonese has phonemic
long and short vowels) is also consistent within
each pair. Only words with nasal codas are used in
CVC word pairs and in each pair the same nasal
coda is selected. After a set of potential stimuli was
chosen, it was given to two native Cantonese
speakers to rate the familiarity of the words on a
scale of ten. The final stimuli comprise 90 words
that are rated above 6 on the familiarity scale.

The mean f0 of six tones of HF and LF words are
shown in Figure 2. A two-factor repeated measures
ANOVA was used to check whether or not the
tone types (tone1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) and the frequency
category (high vs. low) significantly influence a
tone’s mean f0. It was found that frequency
category does not have a significant main effect on
f0, but the interaction between tone types and
frequency category has a significant effect on f0 [F
(5, 30) =4.965, p<.002]. Post-hoc tests suggested
that lexical frequency has a significant main effect
on tone3 [F (1, 7) =33.323, p<.001] and tone5 [F
(1, 7) =10.677, p<.014]. More specifically, the
mean f0 of LF tone3 and tone5 is significantly
higher than their HF counterparts (tone3:
MD=11.824; tone5: MD=6.709). This result
suggests that lexical frequency affects pitch height
in tone production, especially on tones in the midrange (tone3 and tone5). LF words are significantly
higher in pitch than HF counterparts.

Studies on lexical effects on vowel space have
shown that vowels of LF words are more dispersed
than that of their HF counterparts [6]. If lexical
factors are at play on the suprasegmental level as
well, we might expect that the overall tone space of
LF words is more expanded than that of HF words.
Vowel-space dispersion is usually measured
by calculating the mean Euclidean distance from
the center of the speakers’ F1/F2 space [6]. We
propose to measure tone space dispersion parallel
to vowel-space dispersion, by calculating the mean
Euclidean distance from the center of speakers’ f0
space. We thus define the central f0 at each time
point k, Cf0k as the mean f0 a speaker uses for the
time point k along the pitch trajectory, averaged
across words. For each of the ten equidistant points
along the trajectory for every word, we compute
Cf0k, the central f0 at the time point k, as the
average, over all j words spoken by the speaker, of
f0ik, the f0 value of word i at k:
j

1
∑ f 0 ik
j i= 1
Given this mean value, we compute the tonal
distance in semitones (st) between an f0 value of a
particular word i at time point k and the Central f0
at k as follows:
(1)

Cf 0 k =

i
(2) Tonal distance to Central f0 (TDC f 0 i ) = 12 log f 0
2

Cf 0 k

In this study, we measured f0 at ten time points
over a number of items. Therefore to obtain the
averaged tonal distance between a tonal trajectory
to Central f0, we need to get the mean of TDCf0
across all ten time points over all items, as shown
by the following:

Tonal Dispersion =

1 10 j
∑ ∑ TDC f 0 ik
10 j k =1 i =1

Our hypothesis that lexical frequency affects tonal
production predicts that LF words will have a
greater tonal dispersion (greater mean distance to
the center) than HF words.

Results

4.1.1 The tone space of Cantonese
In order to exam quantitatively whether or not
Cantonese speakers make use of an expanded tone
space when producing LF words, we calculated the
mean tonal distance to the center of the speaker’s
f0 space in both HF and LF words. Tone-space
dispersion of HF words and LF words is shown in
Figure 3.

trajectory, that is, whether it influences the early
part, mid part or the late part of the tonal trajectory,
a series of two-factor repeated measures ANOVA
was used to check ten f0 points along the trajectory
individually. The results show that the interaction
of lexical frequency and tone type has a significant
effect on the mid part and late part of the pitch
trajectory (e.g. 60% time: F(5, 30) =3.653,
p<.011; 80% time: F(5, 30) =4.265, p<.005). In
other words, word frequency starts to exert
influence on the pitch height of the tone
trajectories only about halfway through the word.

As suggested by Figure 3, the tone-space of HF
words is on average 2.060 semitones dispersed
from the acoustic f0 center, while the space of LF
words is 2.305 semitones dispersed from the f0
space center. LF words are thus more dispersed
than HF words, confirming that speakers tend to
use a more expanded f0 space when producing LF
words than HF words. A two-factor repeated
measures ANOVA with frequency category (high
and low) as a within-subject factor and gender as a
between-subject factor shows that the usage
frequency of a word has a significant main effect
on tone-space dispersion (F (1,6) = 6.910, p<.039).
The degree of tone-space dispersion of LF words is
on average 0.25 semitone higher than that of HF
words. Gender also has a significant effect on the
degree of tone-space dispersion (F (1,6) = 6.640,
p<.042, MD=.635 st). Female speakers’ tone space
expands on average more than that of male
speakers, which might be due to the wider pitch
range in females.

4.1.2. Three potential competitors
In the Cantonese tone inventory, tone 3, 4 and 6 lie
within a similar pitch range and share a slightly
falling contour. They are highly confusable in
terms of acoustic difference and perceptual
distance and therefore are potential competitors in
acoustic tone space.

Figure 4 shows that in LF words (right panel), the
three tones are more widely distributed in tone
space, i.e. are further apart from each other than
are the f0 trajectories of HF words (left panel). We
measured the acoustic difference among tone
competitors by calculating the pair-wise tonal
distance between two individual competing tones.
The tonal distance between two tones is the
summed Euclidean distance between their f0s at all
ten points. This gives us an idea of how far apart
two tones are distributed.

5. CONCLUSION
This study shows that lexical factors affect
production at the suprasegmental level as well as
the segmental level. Words of the same tone but of
different usage frequency differ significantly in
pitch height. LF words are hyperarticulated and
produced with relatively higher pitch. The tone
space of LF words is more expanded than that of
their HF counterparts; in other words, tones are
more dispersed in this acoustic space.
Previous studies on tonal variation mainly
focus on how tonal contexts influence variation in
the target tone[8], on how neighboring tones
trigger tonal assimilation or dissimilation across
tonal boundaries. In this study the tone elicitation
is done in isolation eliminating possibility of a
contextual cause of variation. Our results thus
show that at least part of the significant remaining
tonal variation in each individual citation tone
production can be explained by lexical factors such
as lexical frequency.

Figure 5 shows greater distance for LF words in
every tone pair, indicating that the distribution of
those tones is more dispersed in one’s tone space
for LF words than that of the HF counterparts. The
