Abstract
Automatically detecting human social intentions and attitudes from spoken conversation is an important task for speech processing
and social computing. We describe a system for detecting interpersonal stance: whether a speaker is ﬂirtatious, friendly, awkward, or
assertive. We make use of a new spoken corpus of over 1000 4-min speed-dates. Participants rated themselves and their interlocutors
for these interpersonal stances, allowing us to build detectors for style both as interpreted by the speaker and as perceived by the
hearer. We use lexical, prosodic, and dialog features in an SVM classiﬁer to detect very clear styles (the strongest 10% in each stance)
with up to 75% accuracy on previously seen speakers (50% baseline) and up to 59% accuracy on new speakers (48% baseline).
A feature analysis suggests that ﬂirtation is marked by joint focus on the woman as a target of the conversation, awkwardness by
decreased speaker involvement, and friendliness by a conversational style including other-directed laughter and appreciations. Our
work has implications for our understanding of interpersonal stance, their linguistic expression, and their automatic extraction.

1. Introduction
In many of our social encounters we observe the speech and gestures of interactants looking for clues as to their
social intention and interpersonal style. Many of these signals are unclear, and ethnomethodologists and conversation
analysts have long described how we focus on the most clear and consistent signals as we build our interpersonal
perceptions (Garﬁnkel, 1967; Heritage, 1984). Through a process of demarcated signaling, speech acts build on one
another, and persons, even in a brief encounter, signal clear social intentions and interpersonal styles.
In this paper, we focus on distinguishing social interactants who are reported to exhibit (or not exhibit) clear social
intentions or styles, detecting what Scherer (2000, 2003) has called interpersonal stances, “affective stance[s] taken
toward another person in a speciﬁc interaction”. We focus on the detection of four kinds of interpersonal stances:
whether a person is viewed as friendly, ﬂirty, awkward, or assertive.

Understanding how stances are signaled is central to situational dynamics and language understanding (Goffman,
1967; Jaffe and Anderson, 1979). Successful automatic detection of interpersonal stances in text and audio features of
human conversation is also crucial for developing socially aware computing systems and more natural dialog agents
(Pentland, 2005; Nass and Brave, 2005; Brave et al., 2005).
We propose to study these interpersonal stances in the context of a particular kind of conversation: romantic dating.
Computational studies of conversation have often focused on speech oriented toward problem-solving tasks such
as direction-ﬁnding or information retrieval. Romantic dating is a quite different domain, offering rich insights into
social meaning because of its inextricable social nature, and with the potential of informing our understanding of
neighboring areas like human gender or biology. We make use of a new corpus composed of conversations from a
particular genre of romantic dating: speed-dates. A speed date is a brief 4-min romantic date. We collected over 1000
such dates, in which participants wore microphones, allowing us to collect approximately 60 h of speech and about
800,000 transcribed words. We also collected pre-test surveys indicating participants general attitudes, preferences,
and demographics, and post-test surveys on date perceptions and follow-up interest. In scorecards after each date each
person judged his or her own level of ﬂirtatiousness, friendliness, awkwardness, and assertiveness and that of his or her
partner.
The task we address is to learn which linguistic cues help detect whether a speaker in a speed-dating conversation
is judged by their interlocutor (or by themselves) as particularly friendly, awkward, ﬂirtatious or assertive. Our goal is
to identify the linguistic signals that distinguish very clear stances; for this reason we focus on features that distinguish
the conversation sides with the highest 10% ratings for a stance from the conversation sides with the lowest 10% ratings
for a stance.
2. Related literature
Our work draws on previous studies that explored a variety of linguistic cues for detecting emotional and interactional
meaning. For example acoustic cues such as low and high F0 or energy and spectral tilt are important in detecting
emotions such as annoyance, anger, sadness, or boredom (Ang et al., 2002; Lee and Narayanan, 2002; Liscombe
et al., 2003), speaker characteristics such as charisma (Rosenberg and Hirschberg, 2005), or personality features like
extraversion (Mairesse et al., 2007; Mairesse and Walker, 2008). Lexical cues like the use of positive emotion words
signal agreeableness (Mairesse et al., 2007), negative emotion words correspond with deceptive speech (Newman
et al., 2003), and speakers that are depressed or under stress use more ﬁrst person singular pronouns (Rude et al., 2004;
Pennebaker and Lay, 2002; Cohn et al., 2004). Dialog features such as the presence of disﬂuencies (as well as prosodic
features) can inform listeners about speakers’ conﬁdence (Brennan and Schober, 2001; Pon-Barry and Shieber, 2011).
Finally, speakers tend to accommodate to their interlocutors, adjusting the parameters of their speech (rate of speech,
pronunciation, pitch level, vocabulary) to match their interlocutor in ways that are sensitive to social variables (Natale,
1975; Ireland et al., 2011; Levitan and Hirschberg, 2011).
While linguistic cues have been explored for many kinds of social meaning, there is insufﬁcient work examining the
linguistic realization of interpersonal stances. The Scherer typology of affective meaning distinguishes interpersonal
stances from four other kinds of affective states by functional criteria (their intensity and duration, focus on a particular
event, and so on), as described in the following list taken from Scherer (2000, 2003):
Emotion: relatively brief episode of synchronized response of all or most organismic subsystems in response to the
evaluation of an external or internal event as being of major signiﬁcance (angry, sad, joyful, fearful, ashamed,
proud, elated, desperate)
Mood: diffuse affect state, most pronounced as change in subjective feeling, of low intensity but relatively long
duration, often without apparent cause (cheerful, gloomy, irritable, listless, depressed, buoyant)
Interpersonal stance: affective stance taken toward another person in a speciﬁc interaction, coloring the interpersonal
exchange in that situation (distant, cold, warm, supportive, contemptuous)
Attitude: relatively enduring, affectively colored belief, preference, or predisposition towards objects or persons (liking,
loving, hating, valueing, desiring)
Personality trait: emotionally laden, stable personality dispositions and behavior tendencies, typical for a person
(nervous, anxious, reckless, morose, hostile, envious, jealous)

The four affective states that are the object of our study (friendly, awkward, ﬂirtatious and assertive) are closest to
Scherer’s interpersonal stances; they are stances taken toward another person in the context of a dating event, and their
affective nature colors the date interaction. While these exact interpersonal stances have not been extensively studied,
there has been important previous work on other affective classes, including emotions, attitudes, and personality traits
that are related to our questions and that have helped shape our own investigation.
First, previous research has shown that speed dating itself can be an important tool for studying interaction (Finkel
et al., 2007; Finkel and Eastwick, 2008; Ireland et al., 2011; Madan et al., 2005; Pentland, 2005). Madan et al. (2005)
examined 60 5-min speed dates where speakers wore audio recorders. They used signal-processing algorithms to
extract four features directly from the audio, without using transcripts: the estimated percentage of speaking time for
each speaker, a measure of the turn-taking inﬂuence of one speaker on the other, a measure of a speaker’s variation
in energy and spectrum (the mean-scaled standard deviation of the energy, formant frequency and spectral entropy)
and the normalized frequency of short backchannel utterances (very short turns). They then used these features to
predict three binary responses from each speaker: whether the speaker was romantically interested in the other, was
interested in being friends with the other, or was interested in maintaining a professional relationship with the other.
They found that a man’s or woman’s variation in energy was correlated with their having romantic interest in their
partner. They also found that a speaker’s having more variation in energy, turn-taking inﬂuence, or (for women
only) frequency of backchannels was correlated with them wanting to be friends with their partner. Madan et al.
(2005) also built SVM classiﬁers using these features to predict whether one speaker was interested in a future
romantic, friendly, or business relationship with the other. They report cross-validation accuracy of between 62%
and 82%, although the impact of these rates are difﬁcult to evaluate as no baseline or majority class statistics are
reported.
Ireland et al. (2011) showed in a speed-date study that similarity in the dyad’s use of function words predicted
mutual romantic interest and relationship stability. They selected and transcribed forty 4-min speed dates from a larger
speed-date experiment. Speakers were considered a ‘match’ if they both expressed interest in meeting each other
after the date. For each date, a measure of function word similarity between the two speakers was computed. For
each of 9 part-of-speech categories (personal pronouns, auxiliary verbs, articles, conjunctions, etc.) they computed
the normalized difference between the count of each category used by the two speakers. These differences were
then averaged, to give a single measure of how similar the two speakers were in their distributions of parts-ofspeech. Thus speakers who used the same number of pronouns, auxiliary verbs, conjunctions and so on as each
other would look similar; speakers who use different number of each of these types would look different. Ireland
et al. (2011) found that similarity in function-word usage predicted matches; more similar dyads were more likely to
match.
The study of cues or signals that correlate with perceived attractiveness has received much attention in human
biology. Studies focusing on speciﬁcally linguistic cues have tended to examine the role of fundamental frequency
(F0). A number of studies with English-speaking participants have suggested that men show a preference for raised
pitch in women’s voices (Feinberg et al., 2008; Jones et al., 2010) and rate them as more attractive (Collins and
Missing, 2003; Puts et al., 2011). Similar studies have shown that women ﬁnd men with lower fundamental frequency
or more closely spaced harmonics (characteristic of longer vocal tracts) more attractive or masculine (Collins, 2000;
Feinberg et al., 2005). Despite this work on attractiveness, few studies have speciﬁcally examined linguistic cues for
the perception of ﬂirtatiousness across sex. Perhaps the closest study is the recent within-sex study of Puts et al. (2011),
who found that women perceive (women’s) voices with higher pitches or more dispersed formants (characteristic of
shorter vocal tracts) as more ﬂirtatious.
Friendliness, by contrast, has received somewhat more attention in the literature, and has been investigated in
a wider variety of languages, although our knowledge is still unfortunately quite limited. House (2005) showed
in Swedish questions that a raised fundamental frequency (F0), especially if it occurs later in its syllable, is
perceived as friendlier than low F0 or a peak early in the syllable. In a study of the perception of friendliness in Chinese statements and questions produced by actors, Chen et al. (2004) and Li and Wang (2004) found
that friendly speech had overall higher average F0 mean and that friendly speech was also faster than neutral
speech.
In English, Liscombe et al. (2003) investigated the LDC Emotional Prosody Speech and Transcripts corpus of
acted speech in 15 different emotional categories. They had new participants relabel the speech into new categories
that including friendliness. They found friendliness to be positively correlated with higher F0 minimum (correlation

92

R. Ranganath et al. / Computer Speech and Language 27 (2013) 89–115

of .32), F0 maximum (.31) and F0 mean (.32), but they also found that all the other positive emotions they considered
(happy, encouraging, interested) also correlated with a higher F0. The best feature that distinguished friendliness from
other positive emotions was a feature they labeled by hand called tilt stress. Tilt stress is the spectral tilt of the vowel
with nuclear stress (spectral tilt was computed as the ﬁrst harmonic subtracted from second harmonic, in dB, over a 30
ms window centered over the middle of the vowel). This and other features used in a classiﬁer achieved an accuracy
of 73.9% at friendliness detection in this corpus, compared to a baseline of 59.1%.
Related to friendliness, Gravano et al. (2011) labeled a number of social variables including likeability and trying
to be liked in the Columbia Games Corpus of subjects talking while jointly playing computer games (Gravano and
Hirschberg, 2011). Some of the strong features associated with males talking to females who were judged as tryingto-be-liked included more contractions, more words related to activation (particularly no), more pleasant words, faster
speaking rate, and expanded pitch range. There was a trend for females talking to males to be judged as trying-tobe-liked when they raised their pitch and used fewer contractions. Speakers who were more likeable exhibited higher
intensity, lower pitch, and more reduced pitch range, more activation (mainly negation) and imagery, more ﬁlled pauses
and contractions, and fewer interjections.
Also related to friendliness is the personality trait agreeability. The agreeableness dimension is one of the big ﬁve
personality dimensions, ranging from agreeable (friendly, cooperative) to disagreeable (antagonistic, faultﬁnding).
Personality traits like agreeability are more stable and typical of a person than an interpersonal stance like friendly, and
also less linked to a particular encounter or event. Nonetheless agreeability and friendliness are clearly related, and so
linguistic features associated with agreeability might be expected to also be associated with friendly dates. Pennebaker
and King (1999), Mehl et al. (2006), Mairesse et al. (2007), and Mairesse and Walker (2008) studied the linguistic
cues correlating with agreeableness (as measured by standard questionnaires) in two corpora, one from student essays
(Pennebaker and King, 1999) and one from spoken conversations (Mehl et al., 2006). Linguistic cues were based on
the LIWC lexicons of Pennebaker et al. (2007), the standard linguistic tool for the social psychological analysis of
lexical features. Mairesse et al. (2007) and Mairesse and Walker (2008) found that the most robust cue to agreeability
across these datasets was the lower uses of swearing and anger words, and in some datasets also more frequent use
of backchannels, lower uses of negative emotional words, lower maximum voice intensity, less pitch variation, and
higher mean pitch.
Assertiveness has not been directly studied, but assertiveness may be related to the personality trait extraversion,
which had received a signiﬁcant amount of attention. Extraverts talk more, talk louder, and with a higher rate of speech
(Mairesse et al., 2007) and use more positive emotion words and compliments (Pennebaker and King, 1999). Mairesse
et al. (2007) also found in conversation that extraverts have greater intensity variation and use more words related to
anger, swearing, and positive and negative emotions. If assertiveness in men is related to perceived masculinity, we
might expect to see assertiveness associated with features like lower fundamental frequency or more closely spaced
harmonics, described above as associated with judgments of masculinity (Feinberg et al., 2005).
By contrast with the other three stances, we know extremely little about the linguistic manifestations of awkwardness.
While awkward speech is associated with autism spectrum disorders, and there has been some discussion of the speech
of patients with high-functioning autism (Grossman et al., 2010), it’s not clear that clinical awkwardness of that sort
is related to the awkwardness that participants describe in speed dates.
Finally, a wide variety of studies have looked at accommodation: the adjustment of prosodic, lexical, or grammatical variables by a speaker to be more similar or more distant from the interlocutor’s speech, as a means of
aligning or disaligning with the interlocutor (Chartrand and Bargh, 1999; Levitan and Hirschberg, 2011; Namdy
et al., 2002; Natale, 1975; Nenkova et al., 2008; Niederhoffer and Pennebaker, 2002; Pardo, 2006; Street, 1983).
But despite the large number of studies it is still not clear the extent to which the presence or extent of accommodation is conditioned on stances like friendliness, ﬂirtatiousness, awkwardness, or assertiveness. The Ireland et al.
(2011) results that found links between romantic matching and accommodation suggests one possible hypothesis:
that ﬂirtatious or friendly speakers might accommodate more. We also expect to see less accommodation in awkward
speakers.
In summary, previous work on these interpersonal stances seems mainly to have focused on friendliness and agreeableness, and to a lesser extent on ﬂirtation and attractiveness. Attractiveness (and to some extent ﬂirtation) has been
associated mainly with higher F0 in women and lower F0 in men. The main linguistic cues that have been suggested
for friendliness are higher and later F0 peaks, faster speech, higher spectral tilt, more frequent use of backchannels,
and lower use of words related to negative emotions, swearing, or anger.

3. The SpeedDate corpus
Our experiments make use of a new corpus we have collected, the SpeedDate corpus. The corpus is based on three
speed-dating sessions run at an elite private American university in 2005 and inspired by prior speed-dating research
(Madan et al., 2005; Pentland, 2005). The graduate student participants volunteered to be in the study and were promised
emails of persons with whom they reported mutual liking. Each date was conducted in an open setting: a large hall,
separated by partitions into cubicles with one or two tables each containing one pair of participants. All participants
wore audio recorders on a shoulder sash, resulting in two audio recordings of each of the approximately 1100 4-min
dates. In addition to the audio, we collected pre-test surveys, event scorecards, and post-test surveys. This is the largest
sample we know of where audio data and detailed survey information were combined in a natural experiment.
The rich survey information included date perceptions and follow-up interest, as well as general attitudes, preferences, and demographic information, including the participants self-reported age, height and weight, hobbies and
interests, dating background, and self-described attributes. Participants were also asked about the conversational style
and intention of the interlocutor. Each speaker was asked to report how often their date’s speech reﬂected different
conversational styles (awkward, friendly, ﬂirtatious, assertive) on a scale of 1–10 (1 = never, 10 = constantly): “How
often did the other person behave in the following ways on this ‘date’?”. In addition they were also asked to rate their
own intentions: “How often did you behave in the following ways on this ‘date’?” on a scale of 1–10; questions are
shown in Fig. 1.
The SpeedDate corpus includes audio data and transcripts. Since both speakers wore microphones, most dates
had two recordings, one from each speaker’s microphone. The acoustic wave ﬁle from each recorder was manually
segmented into a sequence of waveﬁles, each corresponding to one 4-min date. Each date was then transcribed by a
transcription service, producing a diarized transcript that marked words, laughter, ﬁlled pauses, speaker overlap, and
restarts, and timestamped the beginning and end of each turn at the granularity of a second. Turn boundaries for 10% of
the dates were segmented at a ﬁner grain (tenth of a second). Because of the high level of noise, each speaker was much
clearer on his/her own recording; transcribers based their transcription on the clearer recording, using the partner’s
recording when necessary. A sample extract from the transcripts is shown below:

Due to mechanical, operator, and experimenter errors, 19 dates were lost completely, and for an additional 130 we
lost one of the two audio tracks and had to use the remaining track to extract features for both interlocutors. The current
study focuses on the 946 clean dates for which we had complete audio and transcripts. These were on average 812
words long (i.e., on average 406 words from each speaker), and took on average 93 turns. Because some participants
did not provide Likert ratings for some traits (38 of the participants, for example, omitted to self-report their own level
of ﬂirtation), each of our classiﬁer experiments relies on a subset of the 946 dates for which we had the relevant survey
variables as well as the audio and transcripts.
4. Study 1: detection of interpersonal stances and their linguistic features
The goal of our ﬁrst experiment is to identify friendly, ﬂirtatious, awkward, or assertive speakers, and explore the
different linguistic features that are associated with them. Since the stance used by each speaker in each date was
labeled twice (self-reported by the speaker and other-reported), we build separate classiﬁers for detecting self-reported
characteristics and other-reported characteristics. One of our goals is to understand the difference in how the linguistic
associations of a stance or style may differ depending on who is describing it. To learn about the role of gender, we ran
separate experiments for males and females. The combination of 4 stances, two sexes, and self- versus other-reported
style results in 16 different experiments. For each experiment we attempt to predict a particular style as perceived by a
particular gender (e.g., male self-reported ﬂirtation) from linguistic features both of the speaker and of the interlocutor.
In all cases we are interested in understanding the most clear and consistent signals, focusing on distinguishing the
conversation sides with the highest 10% ratings for each stance from the conversation sides with the lowest 10% ratings.
This study focuses on speaker-dependent classiﬁcation: each speaker in the test set is very likely to have been
seen in the training set, allowing the system to learn speciﬁc patterns of behavior for each speaker. In study 2 we
will turn to speaker-independent classiﬁcation to understand how our system generalizes to unseen speakers. The next
section describes the features that we extracted from both waveﬁles and transcripts; the following section describes
the classiﬁers and our evaluation metrics.
4.1. Feature extraction
For each conversation side (one speaker in one date) we extracted a variety of linguistic features. Prosodic features
were extracted from the waveﬁles recorded from the speaker’s microphone (except for the 130 dates for which we only
had one audio ﬁle). Lexical and discourse features were extracted from the transcripts.
4.1.1. Prosodic features
Prosodic features characterize F0, energy, and durational properties of the conversation side. We extracted F0 and
RMS amplitude features using Praat scripts (Boersma and Weenink, 2005), using the handmarked turn boundary times
to extracted each feature over each turn in the conversation side and then took averages and standard deviations over
all turns in a side. For example, the feature F0 min (minimum F0) for a side was computed by taking the minimum F0
value of each turn in that conversation side (not counting zero values of F0), and then averaging these values over all
turns in the side. For F0 we extracted the minimum, maximum and mean values of the conversation side (F0 min, F0
mean, F0 max). No outliers were excluded. An example from the Praat labeling is shown in Fig. 2.
We coded various measures of F0 variation, including the standard deviation of each F0 measure (F0 min, max,
mean); F0 mean sd is thus the deviation across turns from the global F0 mean for the conversation side. F0 sd is the
deviation within a turn for the f0 mean, averaged over turns. F0 sd sd measures the variance of F0 sd across turns. The
pitch range is F0 max–f0 min per turn, averaged over turns. For energy, we computed RMS amplitude values for each
turn, and then computed RMS min, RMS max, and RMS mean values by averaging over all turns in a conversation
side. We then included measure of variation in energy: RMS min SD, RMS mean SD, RMS max SD. Table 1 shows
the 18 raw prosodic features.
Using these extracted features, we conducted exploratory factor analysis to see if latent factors organize the pattern
with which the features are correlated. Six orthogonal (uncorrelated) factors explain 85% of the variance in our 18
acoustic features. All have eigenvalues over 1 and there is a break between 6 and 7 factors in the scree plot suggesting
the use of 6 factors. In addition, nearly identical results hold when oblique (correlated) factors are generated, suggesting

the results are stable. The same factor pattern arose when run the models separately by gender. Only the order of the
factors shifts. Table 2 shows the factor loadings for the six factors.
The resulting 6 factors (max F0, intensity, min F0, variable intensity, long turn, variable F0) were then used instead
of the 18 raw prosodic variables in all further analyses. For each speaker we also measured the average duration of the
turn in seconds (averaging over all turns in a conversation side), the total time for a speaker in each conversation side
(summed over all turns), and the rate of speech (measured in words per second, averaged over turns). Table 3 shows
the ﬁnal set of 7 prosodic features we used in our analyses.

4.1.2. Lexical features
Lexical features have been widely explored in the social-psychological and computational literature. We drew on
the insights of the LIWC lexicons of Pennebaker et al. (2007), the standard for social psychological analysis of lexical
features, creating the ten modiﬁed LIWC features shown in Table 4.1
1 We began by selecting 11 features that the previous work of Mairesse et al. (2007) had found important in detecting personality-related features:
Anger, Assent, Ingest, Insight, Negemotion, Sexual, Swear, I, We, Negate, After of preliminary experiments we removed Anger (because

We also created 8 new lexical features that captured additional hypotheses, shown in Table 5. Hedges are words or
phrases that weaken the force of assertions or indicate uncertainty, marking that some sort of criterion for category
membership is weak or lacking (Lakoff, 1973). While hedges can modify adjectives (a little easier) or nouns (a little
hiking), most hedges in our data are verb phrase or sentential modiﬁers, expressing the speaker’s lack of commitment
to an entire proposition.
I’m sort of just ﬁnishing up some work right now. . .
Yeah, I kind of know that area
It was actually I guess really nice. . .
It’s going to happen I think.
We extracted topical features common in dating conversations, including the topic of dating itself (meta), by
counting the occurrence of words like speed date, ﬂirt, event, and rating, and an academics topic related to the work
and schooling of the graduate student participants. We coded the ﬁve common discourse particles like, I mean, you
know, um, and uh. We conjectured based on the work of Schiffrin (1987) that I mean and you know might be relevant
to speaker engagement and other-directed speech. We included um, and uh because of their link with disﬂuent speech,
which might be associated with awkwardness or ﬂirtation, and like because it may play roles as both a disﬂuency and
a hedge. These are extracted with simple regular expressions; we used expressions based on surrounding context to
automatically eliminate cases of the verb like, leaving only the discourse marker.
4.1.3. Dialog and discourse features
While dialog features are clearly important for extracting social meaning, previous work has focused on prosodic
and lexical cues to social meaning, presumably because discourse features are expensive to hand-label and hard to
automatically extract. We drew on the conversation analysis and dialog act literature to devise discourse features that
could be automatically extracted, shown in Table 6.

it was strongly collinear with Swear), and three others (Assent, Ingest, We) because their use did not correlate with our social variables. We split
two of LIWC’s categories: Ingest into Food and Drink, and Sexual into Sex and Love, added a Hate category, and modiﬁed others to include
words that were common in our sample but not in LIWC’s lists, and to remove ambiguous words that were more often used in different senses than
suggested by the LIWC categories.

The variable totalwords includes all words used by the speaker in a side (space-delimited orthographic strings)
including ﬁlled pauses (uh and um) and fragments (th-, whe-) but not including laughter. About 21% of all turns are
questions. The variable questions codes the total number of questions used by the speaker in the conversation side,
extracted via question marks, and also (for some sentences without questions marks because of interruptions, etc.) by
appropriate auxiliary inversion do you, are you, could you, etc.). We separately coded clariﬁcation questions (repair
questions or NTRIs for ‘next turn repair indicators’ (Schegloff et al., 1977)), turns in which a speaker signals lack of
hearing or understanding:
FEMALE:
MALE:

Okay. Are you excited about that?
Excuse me?

The following regular expression was used to detect NTRIs:
What? | Sorry | Excuse me | Huh? | Who? | Pardon? | Say again?
| Say it again? | What’s that | What is that
Interruptions were coded by the transcribers with double dashes at the end of the preceding turn; the female below
is coded as having a single interruption. The variable codes the total number of interruptions taken by the speaker in
the conversation side:
MALE:
FEMALE:

Do you really get a lot of information from–
It’s really in the development stages so far so I haven’t applied it to a ﬁeld application at all.

Laughter was marked in the transcripts by the transcribers. We extracted two different laughter variables based
on the position of laughter in the speaker’s turn. Initial laughter occurred at the beginning of the turn (or took the
entire turn). We conjectured these would be cases of laughing at the other. Turn-medial/ﬁnal laughter were laughs that
occurred in the middle or the end of a turn. We hypothesized these would be cases of a speaker laughing at themselves.
In addition to ﬁlled pauses like uh and um, we coded disﬂuent restarts, which were explicitly marked by the
transcribers using dashes:
Uh, I–there’s a group of us that came in–
Extracting these dialog acts required more complex regular expressions. One such move is an assessment, a dialog
act that expresses the speaker’s sentiment toward the other’s recent utterance. Negative assessments, which we call
sympathy, are phrases like “That must be tough on you”:
MALE:
. . .consulting, which is the last thing I want to do.
FEMALE: Oh, that’s too bad.

Positive assessments (or appreciations) are phrases like “ “Good for you!”:
FEMALE:
MALE:

I played in the orchestra.
Oh that’s cool.

We designed regular expressions based on the pattern below drawn from the assessment literature (Goodwin, 1996;
Goodwin and Goodwin, 1987; Jurafsky et al., 1998), and the hand-labeled Switchboard dialog act corpus (Jurafsky
et al., 1997), but augmented with structures to handle expressions like “Awesome”, “Good for you!”, “Oh no”, “I had
the same problem”, and so on:
Pro Term + Copula + (Intensifier) + Assessment Adjective
We also coded agreements, expressions of strong agreement with the other, e.g., That’s true, That’s right, Deﬁnitely,
For sure, and so on.
4.1.4. Accommodation features
We discussed in Section 2 the previous literature on speaker’s adjusting their linguistic production to be more
similar to or more different from that of the other. Drawing on this literature, we investigated four kinds of speaker’s
accommodation to the other’s speech: rate of speech accommodation, function word accommodation, content word
accommodation, and laughter accommodation.
We measured rate of speech accommodation by computing whether there were correlations between the rates used
by two speakers over time, for example whether a speaker sped up when the other sped up. We followed the turncorrelational methodology of Niederhoffer and Pennebaker (2002), considering the sequences of rates for each speakers

turn as a vector and computing the Pearson’s correlation between the two turn vectors. A high correlation indicates
that the changes over time in speakers rates of speech are correlated; as one speaker gets faster or slower, so does the
other.
We measured how often a speaker uses a function word that was also used in the other’s previous turn. For each
function word w (Table 7) in a given speaker’s turn, w is an accommodated function word if it also occurs in the
immediately preceding turn of the other. The variable function-accommodation is the total number of accommodated
function words over the side.
Content words are deﬁned as any word that is not a function word. For each content word w in a given speaker’s
turn, if w also occurs in the immediately preceding turn of the other, we count w as an accommodated content word.
The raw count of accommodated content words is be the total number of these accommodated content words over
every turn in the conversation side. Because content words vary widely in frequency, we normalized our counts by the
frequency of each word. We combined our entire speed-date corpus with the Switchboard corpus of conversational
American English (Godfrey et al., 1992) and used this larger corpus to compute the frequency of each word in the
speed-date corpus. We then computed the variable content-accommodation by summing (over all turns in a side) the
inverse frequency of each content word that also occurred in the other’s immediately preceding turn. We computed
laughter-accommodation by summing over all turns in which a speaker laughed and the other also laughed in the
immediately preceding turn (Table 8).

4.1.5. Feature normalization
Before building classiﬁers, we preprocessed the data. For all studies some features were normalized by the total
word count in the conversation side: hate, academics, love, sex, drink, food, negemo, swear, negate, hedge,
meta, ntri, like, imean, youknow, you, restart, laughaccom, initlaugh, midlaugh, I, uh, um. We follow
common procedure in logging rate of speech.

100

R. Ranganath et al. / Computer Speech and Language 27 (2013) 89–115

We then standardize all the features to have zero mean and unit variance globally across the training set before
training any model. We did this to avoid imposing a prior on any of the features based on their numerical values.2
We ran our experiments both speaker-normalizing all prosodic feature and without speaker normalization; we saw no
average differences in accuracy and so we give results without speaker normalization.
4.2. Classiﬁcation
Our goal in this work is to learn to detect and characterize clear cases of a conversation style. For this reason we
selected our training and test sets from a subset of all the dates, choosing only highly indicative individuals whose
stance falls in either the global top ten percent of ratings or the global bottom ten percent of ratings.
For each of the 16 experiments, then, we ﬁrst combined all three of the SpeedDate events into a single corpus. For
the experiment on detecting self-reported male ﬂirtation, for example, we sorted all the 946 dates by the self-reported
male ﬂirtation score, and then took the top ten percent of date sides to form our positive class examples and the bottom
ten percent to form the negative class examples. Due to missing ratings and audio, the corpus for self-report of male
ﬂirtation consists of 174 examples. The other 15 experiments had similar sizes.
Because of the very small datasets, rather than break out a ﬁxed training and test set, we use ﬁve-fold cross validation
to train and evaluate our model. We split the data into ﬁve folds of equal size, using four of the folds for training and
one for test in round robin, so every example ends up in a test set. This yields a data split with 80% of the data in the
training set and 20% in the test set. Each fold was split 50/50 between the positive and negative class. To help ensure
that we learned features that were general, particularly given the small size of our datasets, we randomized our data
ordering and repeated the test 30 times.
For classiﬁcation we trained both a linear C-SVM and an L1 regularized logistic regression. Our goal in the C-SVM
is to solve, in primal form:
1
minγ,w,b ||w||2 + C

s.t. y(i) (wT x(i) + b) ≥ 1 − ξi ,
ξi ≥ 0, i = 1, . . . , m

i = 1, . . . , m

(1)

where m is the number of training examples, x(i) is the ith training examples, and y(i) is the ith class (1 for the positive
class, −1 for the negative class). The ξ i are the slack variables that allow this algorithm to work for non linearly
separable datasets.
In logistic regression we train a vector of feature weights θ ∈ Rn so as to make the following classiﬁcation of some
output variable y for an input observation x3 :
p(y|x; θ) =

1
1 + exp(−θ T x)

In regularized logistic regression we ﬁnd the weights θ which maximize the following optimization problem:
log p(yi |xi ; θ) − α ∗ R(θ)

R(θ) is a regularization term used to penalize large weights. We chose R(θ), the regularization function, to be the L1
norm of θ. That is, R(θ) = ||θ||1 = n |θi |.

In our case, given the training set Strain , test set Stest , and validation set Sval , we trained the weights θ as follows:

1
regularized logistic regression both minimize a norm of the weight vector, there is a bias to put weight on feature A (the weight on feature B would
need to be 1000 times larger to carry the same effect). The reduction to unit variance was performanced for the same reasons.

We chose L1 -regularization because the number of training examples to learn well grows logarithmically with the
number of input variables (Ng, 2004), and to achieve a sparse activation of our features to ﬁnd only the most salient
explanatory variables. The search space over the sparsity parameter α is bounded around an expected sparsity to prevent
overﬁtting.
Both the C-SVM and the L1 -regularized logistic regression’s optimization problems have hyperparameters (C for
the SVM and α for regression). We learn these hyperparameters by taking one of the folds from the training set to form
a validation set and evaluating the model trained on the rest of the folds in the training set for a speciﬁc hyperparameter
on the validation set. We chose the hyperparameter that is best on the validation set. We searched the hyperparameter
space using a log-spaced line search with a base of 2. To produce the ﬁnal model we train on the entire training set
using the learned hyperparameter. Our models were trained with the LIBLINEAR software package (Fan et al., 2008).
We evaluated both of our classiﬁers on the test set by computing the accuracy, the number of correct examples
divided by the total number of test examples. For feature analysis we used weights generated by L1 regularized logistic regression, whose sparse feature weights are particularly useful in feature analysis (Ng, 2004). In order to select
important features for analysis, we ﬁrst computed the median of the weights for a given feature across all 30 runs
of each classiﬁer with randomized ordering. Any feature whose median weight was non-zero was selected. A feature having a non-zero median will have the majority of its weights as either positive or negative, which will be rare
when using a sparse algorithm. We then ran a two tailed t-test at the .05 signiﬁcance level with a null hypothesis
of “the feature weight has a mean of 0” and veriﬁed that our non-zero median criteria was a stricter criteria than
the t-test for all 16 of our models (there was no feature that had a non-zero median that wasn’t signiﬁcant according to the t-test.) The boxplot in Fig. 3 demonstrates the weight distributions for one stance: self-reported female
awkwardness.
4.3. Results
We report in Table 9 the accuracies for the 16 classiﬁers trained for both the SVM and the logistic regression. The ﬁrst
two rows shows the results from SVM on each of the 4 conversation styles, for each gender, and for both self-reported
and other-reported styles. The next two rows show the results from the L1 regularized logistic regression. The SVM
outperformed L1 regularized logistic regression, and was always signiﬁcantly better than the baseline (paired t-test,

p < .0001). At least part of the reason for the these high accuracies is the reliance on speaker speciﬁc characteristics in
the training set; we will see lower scores in our speaker-independent study below.
4.4. Study 1B: quartile experiments
Although our goal to study the clearest examples of each stance led us to choose the top and bottom decile (10%)
of each stance as the positive and negative instances, we also ran each experiment using the top and bottom quartiles
(25%). We did this for two reasons. First, ten is an arbitrary cutoff; a different cutoff might capture consistent clear
behavior. Second, the quartile experiment allowed us to include a much larger training and test set; on average 473
dates instead of 189 dates to crossvalidate through. Finally, the larger data set makes the feature analysis we want to
run in the next section more robust and helps avoid overﬁtting features of individuals.
The quartile experiment does run the risk of including observations in the middle of the stance range which are not
clear examples of a stance. The label cutoffs for the top/bottom quartile can also be skewed; the cutoff for self-assessed
male friendliness is 7 for negatives and 10 for positives, while for self-assessed male assertiveness it’s 4 for negatives
and 7 for positives. Nonetheless we felt the extra robustness and signiﬁcantly more data makes it worth examining this
second set of classiﬁers.
As with our primary experiments to study the clearest examples, we ran 16 experiments stemming from the combinations of 4 stances, two sexes, and self versus other reported style, but where the positive and negative examples
were determined by the top and bottom quartiles.
We report in Table 10 the accuracies for the 16 classiﬁers trained for both the SVM and the logistic regression
on top and bottom quartiles (25%). The ﬁrst two rows shows the SVM results on each of the 4 conversation styles,
for each gender, and for both self-reported and other-reported styles. The next two rows show the results from the L1
regularized logistic regression. For the quartile experiments L1 regularized logistic regression generally outperforms
the SVM, and was always signiﬁcantly better than the baseline (paired t-test, p < .0001).
As expected, the task of distinguishing the top quartile from the bottom quartile is harder than distinguishing the
top and bottom decile. The mean accuracy of the SVM classiﬁer on the top decile/bottom decile (averaging all scores
in the ﬁrst two rows of Fig. 9) is .69. By contrast, the mean accuracy of the SVM classiﬁer on the top quartile/bottom
quartile (Table 10) is .62.

4.5. Feature analysis
Tables 11–14 show feature weights for each stance from the decile results. Although we used the feature selection
algorithm described in Section 4.2 that only considers features that were signiﬁcant across the 30 randomized test
runs, we were concerned that the large number of features may still overﬁt the small test set. This is particularly true
with the decile classiﬁer, which uses less than 200 conversations. We therefore focus in this discussion on features that
are particularly robust. In the tables below, features that hold across self- and other-ratings are boldfaced. Boldfaced
features that were also signiﬁcant in the quartile study (averaging just under 500 conversations) are further underlined.
Our discussion will highlight the boldfaced features that hold for both the self and other labels, and especially those
that are also signiﬁcant in the quartile study.
A number of features were consistently associated with ﬂirtation. Women rated as ﬂirting (whether by self or other,
generally whether in the decile or quartile studies) tend to use negation (especially the word don’t but also no and
not), use the word like, and use medial laughter. In the decile but not quartile studies, ﬂirting women also use I; in the
quartile but not decile studies, ﬂirting women use more appreciations and you know. Men rated as ﬂirting (generally
either by self or other, in both the decile and quartile studies) tend to use the words you, you know, and um, and are
less likely to use words about their academic work. In the quartile studies, ﬂirting men also talked about sex. There
are also strong characteristics of the speech of men talking to ﬂirting women; in both the decile and quartile studies
these men use appreciations and accommodate the woman’s function words. Some ﬂirtation features differed between
self- and other-rating; in both the decile and quartile studies, men who self-reported as ﬂirting use less negation, but
this feature was not associated with other-assessed ﬂirtation.
Turn-medial/ﬁnal laughter is the most robust cue for friendliness, associated with both self- and other-rating for both
men and women in both the decile and quartile studies. Lower use of negative emotion was also robustly associated
in the quartile study, and to a lesser extent in the decile study, with friendly men and women, both self- and otherassessed. Across the studies and labelers, friendly men tend to use less hedges, less uh, less you know, and have more
varied intensity, while friendly women tend to use clariﬁcation questions. In the quartile but not decile studies, friendly
women (both self- and other-assessed) have higher maximum pitch and greater pitch variance, and are more likely to
use negation and initial laughter. In both studies, men who use agreement or swearing are perceived as, but do not

self-report as, friendlier, and women who use more I self-report as, but are not perceived as, friendlier. There are also
strong characteristics of the speech of the friendly person’s interlocutor; in both the decile and quartile studies men
accommodate friendly woman’s content words and have more variable intensity, while women use more appreciations
with friendly men.
The most robust cue to awkwardness was hedges, which are more frequent in both studies in awkward men and
women, whether self- or other-rated. Awkward women in both studies, and awkward men in the quartile study, were
also more likely to use negation. Awkward women tended to speak faster, while awkward men ask more questions and
are less likely to use I mean and more likely to use negative emotion. In the quartile but not decile studies, awkward
men are also likely to speak less, speak softer and with less variation in intensity, and use less clariﬁcation questions.
Assertive women (self- and other-assessed, decile and quartile) use more negation, more disﬂuent restarts, more I,
more function word accommodation, and tended to use more appreciations and clariﬁcation questions. Assertive men
used more total words, more negative emotion, less negation, and tended to use less uh. In the decile study assertive
men dropped their minimum pitch; in the quartile study assertive men raised their maximum pitch, and were more
likely to swear and use you. Self-assessed (but not other-assessed) assertive men asked more questions. We defer deeper
discussion of features to Section 8.
5. Study 2: speaker-independent detection of interpersonal stances
Our main study suggests that all four interpersonal stances are detectable. In study 1, speakers could appear in both
the training set and the test set; each test set individual appeared about 5 times in the training set (averaged across

all randomizations of our 16 tests). Although the speaker identity was not a feature available to the classiﬁer, having
a test speaker in training nonetheless means the algorithm has seen characteristics of that speaker. In order to see to
what extent the classiﬁcation accuracy is due to this kind of speaker-speciﬁc knowledge, in this section we describe
our speaker-independent detection of stances.

5.1. Methods
The SpeedDate corpus was created by three separate speed dating events a few weeks apart with completely different
participants. Study 1 lumped together all three events. In this study we use distinct events for training and testing, crossvalidating by training on two of the events and testing on the third event. This ensures that every example will be tested
in each of the three sub-experiments and that no speaker will be in both the training and test set.
Recall that for each of our 16 classiﬁcation tasks from Experiment 1, we took the top ten percent of Likert rating
across all the events as positive examples for a style and we took the bottom ten percent as negative examples for a style.
Given our small dataset, doing event-based cross validation with this data split can lead to very uneven distributions of
positive class and negative class examples, since one event could contain very few examples of either particular class.
An example of the imbalance for an iteration of event-based cross validation can been seen in Table 15.
The imbalance in the training sets poses an issue for using an SVM. We can see in the SVM optimization problem
in Eq. 1 that each training example contributes equally to the objective, causing a bias towards the majority class in
our imbalanced training setting. To remove this bias in the objective function we trained a weighted SVM (Huang
and Du, 2005), which are useful if one of the classes appears with low frequency in training. Infrequent classes can
be made more important in a weighted SVM by given them larger weights, generally improving the classiﬁcation
accuracy of that class. Since we have one class that appears at a lower rate than the other and we want to accurately
classify both of our classes we used weights of (# positive training examples)/(# training examples) on the negative
examples and weights of (# negative training examples)/(# training examples) on the positive examples. This choice of
weights ensures that both classes contribute to the objective function of the weighted SVM Eq. (6) equally; the weight
on training examples of one class is proportional to the number of training examples in the other class.

We trained a weighted SVM for each of our 16 tasks mentioned in Study 1. We used the same feature transformations
as Study 1, but used an alternative validation set (from holding out 20% of the training set) to learn the hyperparameters
since we no longer have balanced folds. The top decile and bottom decile deﬁne a cutoff at a particular Likert rating;
at this rating there are generally many more conversations than needed at that rating to build the top decile or bottom
decile. In this experiment, we randomly select data from these 2 pools to build the top and bottom deciles and run
across 5 such randomizations.
Accuracies of our SVM model, along with a majority class baseline, are shown below. Note that because we chose
the top 10% and bottom 10% as positive and negative examples globally, the labels in the test event will always be

tilted towards the minority class of the training set.4 This issue is mitigated by the fact that our SVM learning does
not take advantage of this class bias. Instead, our training algorithm is affected by the same majority class issue as the
baseline because it has no knowledge of the constraint.
5.2. Results
We report the results for the 16 speaker-independent classiﬁers in Table 16. In every case except for self-report of
female friendliness the SVM classiﬁer is signiﬁcantly better than the majority class baseline (McNemar’s test, 2-tailed,
p < .05).
5.3. Discussion
Our results show that for 15 of our 16 stances, even with an unseen speaker it is possible to extract interpersonal
styles with performance better than the baseline majority classiﬁer. The performance improvement over the baseline,
however, is not as large as in Study 1. This fact, together with the poor performance on self-report of friendliness in
females suggests that allowing the classiﬁer to see the range of traits from test speakers in Study 1 was a useful cue to
accurate classiﬁcation.
6. Study 3: linguistic versus non-linguistic features
We have shown in Studies 1 and 2 that linguistic factors are useful in predicting a conversational style both when we
have seen the speaker before and when we haven’t. In these studies, however, we did not consider any non-linguistic
factors that might play a role in extraction of interpersonal style. It is possible that the predictive power of our linguistic
features might already by captured by non-linguistic traits of a person like homophily (the similarity between the
speakers) or physical characteristics like height or age difference. Our goal in this study is to explore the relevance
of non-linguistic features to the interpersonal stances, and see whether non-linguistic and linguistic features can be
combined.
6.1. Methods
We chose three stances to explore the role of non-linguistic features: self-report of ﬂirtation for both male and
females, and self-report of assertiveness for men. We chose ﬂirtation because some of the non-linguistic features were
designed to be related to romantic attraction, pairing it with assertiveness, a stance for which we have no reason to
expect the non-linguistic cues to have any predictive power as it is not directly related to romantic attraction.
4 This is a consequence of doing cross validation. Overall the number of positive class examples is the same as the number of negative class
examples, so if we are training on two of the events, and these two events have an excess of one class, then the remaining event which is the test set
must have an excess of the other class because the number of examples in each class is equal globally.

Fig. 4. The registration survey with the list of interests ﬁlled out by each speed date participant.

For each of the styles we trained two SVMs: one using just the non-linguistic features and one using both the
linguistic and non-linguistic features. We also trained an L1 -regularized logistic regression classiﬁer using just the
non-linguistic features to help in feature weight analysis. We use the feature normalization scheme, hyperparameter
learning, and the cross-validation scheme outlined in Study 1 to train and evaluate our models.
6.2. Non-linguistic features
Table 17 shows the non-linguistic features, each calculated from a survey that was handed out at the beginning of
the event. Participants gave their height and weight (from which we computed their BMI), their age, and ﬁlled out a
set of hobby interests.
The registration survey with the list of interests are shown in Fig. 4. Interests were labeled from 1 to 10 with 10
indicating very interested in the topic. We calculated interest similarity between two speakers using the L2 norm,
i.e. by taking the square root of the sum of squares of interest difference across several interest categories. The L2
norm assumes that lacking a little similarity on a couple of categories isn’t as different as being very unsimilar in one
category.5
6.3. Results
Table 18 shows results for the three stances. Non-linguistic features perform better than chance for all 3 tasks
(paired t-test, 2-tailed, p = . 0001) but not nearly as well as the linguistic features by themselves (paired t-test, 2-tailed,
p = . 0001).
For ﬂirtation, models with both the linguistic and non-linguistic features perform better than either feature set by
itself.6 For assert, however, the non-linguistic features hurt performance when added to the linguistic features.

We found that the L2 norm outperformed the L1 norm on classiﬁcation accuracy for calculating interest similarity.
Using a paired 2-tailed t-test, the models for men are signiﬁcantly better (p = . 0001) as is the model for women (p = . 05).

6.4. Feature analysis
Table 19 shows the signiﬁcant non-linguistic features. For both male and female ﬂirtation, physical traits are
important. Men or women with higher BMI are more likely to report themselves as ﬂirting, as are both taller men
and shorter women. Men tend to ﬂirt with low-BMI women, while women, by contrast, ﬂirt with high-BMI men. As
men progress through more dates, they report themselves as getting more ﬂirtatious. Males that report themselves as
assertive tend to be taller and have a higher BMI. Interest homophily was not a signiﬁcant predictor of any of the
stances.
6.5. Discussion
Linguistic features clearly offer information beyond what is captured in non-linguistic variables like height, BMI,
and homophily. Non-linguistic features are mainly useful in predicting ﬂirtation, conﬁrming our intuition that these
particular non-linguistic features, which were designed to predict romantic attachment, are not appropriate for predicting
assertiveness. Flirtation, by contrast, is a more likely proxy for romantic interest than is assertiveness.
7. Study 4: systematic differences between self- and other-perceptions
Within the Speed Date corpus, the speaker’s interpersonal stance is labeled by both the speaker and the hearer. In
the prior section, we focused on features that were robust indicators of a stance when labeled by the speaker and when
labeled by the hearer. In many cases, however, speakers and hearers draw on different signals in this labeling task. For
example, it is possible that men may think they are indicating friendliness with certain linguistic signals while their
female interlocutors may identify male friendliness in alternative signals.
The Brunswikian lens is one model of how the relationship between a surface linguistic feature and a kind of affective
meaning like a stance may be different for the producer of that affect than for the perceiver of the affect (Scherer, 1978).
There is some evidence for this Brunswikian difference in our data. Some features have stronger associations for the
speaker than the perceiver. For example men who self-report as ﬂirting use less negation, but women do not seem to
rely on negation as a cue for labeling ﬂirtation. Similarly, women who use more I self-report as friendlier, but they are
not perceived as friendlier when they use I. Other features have stronger associations for the perceiver than the speaker;
men who use agreement or swearing are perceived as, but do not self-report as, friendlier.
In addition to differences in the linking of features to stances, we also found systematic differences between the
labels that the two participants in a conversation gave to their stances in that conversation. We noticed that speakers in
general tend to assign similar values to their own stance as they do to their partner’s stance. This effect seemed to be
much stronger than the tendency of the two speakers to agree on the stance label for a participant.

We tested this observation by computing two sets of Pearson correlations. The ﬁrst tests how similarly the respondent
labels their own stance to their labeling of their partner. The second tests how similarly the respondent labels their
partner with how similarly the partner labels their self. As Table 20 shows, for all four styles, speakers’ perception of
others is strongly correlated with the speakers’ perception of themselves, far more so than with what the others actually
think they are doing.7
Note that although perception of the other does not correlate highly with the other’s intent for any of the styles,
the correlations are somewhat better (.15) for ﬂirting, perhaps because in the speed-date setting speakers are focusing
more on detecting this behavior (Higgins and Bargh, 1987). It is also possible that for styles with positive valence
(friendliness and ﬂirting) speakers see more similarity between the self and the other than for negative styles (awkward
and assertive) (Krahé, 1983).
Why should this strong bias exist to link their own stance with that of the other of the other? One possibility
is that speakers are just not very good at capturing the intentions of others in 4 min. Speakers would instead base
their judgments on their own behavior or intentions, perhaps because of a bias to maintain consistency in attitudes
and relations (Festinger, 1957; Taylor, 1970) or to assume there is reciprocation in interpersonal perceptions (Kenny,
1998).
We propose an alternative hypothesis, however, which is that our participants describe these interpersonal stances
as being fundamentally about the relation between the two actors and the conversation as a whole, and not merely
facts about an individual speaker. That is, speakers are to some extent labeling “conversations that felt friendly” or
“conversations that felt awkward” instead of just “friendly interlocutors”. Evidence for this hypothesis is the large
number of cases where the linguistic features of the “other” for a stance bears a strong relation to the stance labeled
for the speaker.
If true, this hypothesis suggests that research on interpersonal stance and affective meaning like personality in the
dyad need to be careful in teasing apart aspects of the individual from aspects of the conversation. One solution that
we are exploring is the use of statistical methods like the Actor-Partner Interdependence Model (Kenny et al., 2006),
which distinguish intra-personal actor effects from inter-personal partner effects.
8. General discussion
Our results show that it is possible to use automatically extracted prosodic, lexical, and dialog features to extract
interpersonal stances (ﬂirtation, friendliness, awkwardness, assertiveness), with performance of up to 78% compared
to a 50% baseline for contrasting prototypes when test speakers occur in training, and up to 53% compared to a 37%
baseline with unseen test speakers. The linguistic features we used offer information for classiﬁcation even beyond
non-linguistic features like shared interests (homophily) and physical attributes like weight and height and the basic
prosodic features that have traditionally been studied in the bonding literature in sociology and social psychology.
These results also have a number of implications for modeling stances and their associated linguistic features. One
implication is the presence of a sort of collaborative conversational style (probably related to the collaborative ﬂoor
of Edelsky (1981) and Coates (1996)), cued by the use of turn-medial/ﬁnal laughter, sympathy (in men), clariﬁcation
questions (in women), an avoidance of negative emotional language and hedges, and to some extent accommodation,
appreciations, and the use of you. These collaborative techniques were used by both women and men who were labeled

7 This was true no matter how the correlations were run, whether with raw Likert values, with ego-centered (transformed) values and with self
ego-centered but other raw.

as friendly, and occurred less with men labeled as awkward. Women themselves displayed more of this collaborative
conversational style when they labeled the men as friendly. Although we found no prosodic correlations of friendliness
in our decile study, in our larger (quartile) study, we found that friendly women had higher maximum pitch and more
pitch variance, consistent with the literature (Chen et al., 2004; House, 2005; Li and Wang, 2004; Liscombe et al.,
2003; Mairesse et al., 2007; Gravano1 et al., 2011).
Our results on ﬂirtation suggested different patterns for men and women. Flirting in women is associated with
negation, the word like, and collaborative style (appreciations, medial laughter) and in the decile study with the word
I. Flirting in men is associated with greater use of you, you know, um, and words about sex, as well as less likelihood
of talking about work. We did not in general see the increase in F0 maximum suggested by the results of Puts et al.
(2011), although it was at least associated with other-reported ﬂirtation in the decile study.
The fact that men tend to use you and you know (soliciting hearers orientation toward the speaker’s talk (Schiffrin,
1987)) while women tend to use I suggests a conversational norm in which women are the target or topic of the
conversation. Previous research on politeness (Brown and Levinson, 1978), strategic local action (Leifer and Rajah,
2000) and contextualizational cues (Gumperz, 1982) regard this kind of targeting as a key feature of interaction. In
the case of politeness, the empowered party is usually the target of communication and their face a matter of mutual
concern and protection (Goffman, 1967). Since women are much more selective in these dates and hence generally
make the decision on whether to continue the date, her face may be a natural target for both parties. We are currently
analyzing other cues and implications of the topicality of women in the conversation.
As for the negation used by ﬂirting women, this may be related to teasing and/or self-deprecation; we return to this
issue below in our further discussion of negation.
The linguistic manifestations of an assertive stance do show some commonalities with extraversion, discussed in
Section 2. Features of both extraversion and assertive speech include talking more (for men only), variable intensity
(for women in the decile study only), faster speech (for self-reported women in both the decile and quartile study), and
increased use of negative emotional words (for men only) and swearing (for men only). The decrease in men’s pitch
ﬂoor that we found with assertive men in the decile study also seems to be consistent with the ﬁndings of Feinberg
et al. (2005) that women ﬁnd men with lower fundamental frequency more masculine, but we also saw an increased
pitch maximum for assertive men in the quartile study, which makes us loath to draw conclusions here.
On the other hand, some of our assertive features were very different from previous results on extraversion. For
example we found the use of negatives to be the strongest assertive feature for women but Mairesse et al. (2007) found
extraverts to use signiﬁcantly less negatives, at least in written essays. We saw increased use of hedges by assertive
men, but previous research suggest that extraverts use less hedges. Our ﬁnding of increased restarts (disﬂuencies)
by assertive women is also not what would be expected for extraversion. In sum, our results suggest that ratings of
assertiveness did capture some aspects of the extraverted personality, but that assertiveness and extraversion were not
completely aligned and further study is warranted.
For awkwardness, many of the linguistic cues seem to be associated with psychological distancing, the mechanism
of psychologically removing oneself from a difﬁcult or traumatic event. Previous research has shown that of ﬁrstperson singular, longer words, articles, and avoidance of the present tense are signs of distancing (Cohn et al., 2004).
The decreased use of I in some awkward women, and the strongly decreased use of I mean in awkward men is thus
consistent with these distancing cues (Schiffrin, 1987). But by far the strongest linguistic association with awkward
men and women is the use of hedges. Hedges like sort of, kind of, maybe, and a little are used to express the speaker’s
lack of commitment to a proposition, but our results suggest that hedges are also used metalinguistically to indicate the
speaker’s psychological distancing from or discomfort with the situation; words which are distancing at the semantic
or pragmatic level acquire the metapragmatic connotations of distancing. This use of hedges to indicate discomfort
is consistent with research showing that hedges can extend their semantic or pragmatic meaning to metalinguistic
meaning (Jurafsky, 1996), and research showing that other kinds of meaning like negation have this metalinguistic
extension (Potts, 2011). Our results suggests that hedges may be a useful cue to augment current models for detecting
psychological distancing. The fact that awkward men in the quartile study are also likely to speak less, speak more softly,
and use less variation in intensity may also be related to a lack of engagement. This association between distancing
and awkward speakers may be due to personality factors like low self-esteem, or it may simply be that speakers who
are distancing themselves from an uncomfortable date are likely to describe themselves (or be described) as awkward.
In addition to the results on the individual stances, our work also has a number of implications for individual features
themselves. We show that the two ﬁlled pauses um and uh function very differently. Um marks ﬂirting for both men

112

R. Ranganath et al. / Computer Speech and Language 27 (2013) 89–115

and women. Uh, on the other hand, has a negative correlation with almost all of the stances. Uh is used less by assertive
men or women, and less by men who describe themselves as friendly or ﬂirtatious. This suggests that uh is somehow
dispreferred or marked, an idea that is consistent with recent research on uh by Acton (2010), who showed that speakers
associate uh with connotations of stupidity.
Another implication of our study is the separation of laughter into different classes. Distinguishing turn-initial and
turn-medial laughter is one of the contributions of our study. Turn-medial or turn-ﬁnal laughter is part of friendly
collaborative conversational style. In a follow-up investigation, we analyzed a number of example of laughter in the
corpus, and found that this kinds of laughter is often used by a speaker to poke fun at themselves, as in the following
two examples:
FEMALE:
MALE:

Why are you single?
Why I’m single? That’s a good question. [laughter]

MALE:
FEMALE:

And I stopped by the–the beer party the other day.
Oh goodness. And you saw me in- [laughter]

Turn-initial laughter, by contrast, seems to play other functions. One common use of initial laughter is laughing at
your other’s jokes, as the woman does in the following:
MALE:
FEMALE:

. . .“speed ﬁlling out forms” is what this should be called.
[laughter] Yeah.

Initial laughter in the SpeedDate corpus is also used for teasing the other, as in the following example, where the
man accuses the woman of being defensive:
MALE:
FEMALE:
MALE:

You’re on the rebound.
huh–uh.
[laughter] Defensive.

These corpus investigations suggest that turn-ﬁnal laughter is self-directed, a way for a speaker to poke fun at
himself or herself, while turn-initial laughter is other-directed, a way of laughing at the other’s jokes or teasing them.
The difference between these two kinds of laughter, cued as they are just by turn position, makes them easy to
differentially extract. The roles of these two kinds of laughter should be examined in other domains.
Our results also suggest a number of directions for the study of negation. We found that women’s use of negation
(especially don’t, not, and no) is particularly associated with ﬂirtation, assertiveness, and awkwardness. In a brief corpus
investigation we explored the link with ﬂirtation. A number of ﬂirty cases of negation seem to be women teasing men,
challenging them by ordering them not to do something, or refusing to do something for them:
MALE:
FEMALE:

I have to say that that’s a great question.
No, don’t say that. That’s a stalling technique in a business interview. It’s not allowed here. [Laughter].

Below are some other negative utterances with these properties:
FEMALE:
FEMALE:
FEMALE:

What three things? Really three things? You’re not going to say, like, three best albums or-?
Are we in the same- I don’t want to give you my email address.
What if I don’t like your plan?

Negation seems also to be used by women for self-deprecation; in particular, note the co-occurrence in both of these
examples with turn-medial laughter, another cue for self-deprecation:
FEMALE:
FEMALE:

Do you know how to do math? [Laughter] I don’t. So I’m an English major.
But actually I haven’t studied in a while, so I uh, I’ve forgotten a lot. [Laughter]

Deeper analysis of the relation of negation to ﬂirtation, and understanding the links to awkwardness and assertiveness
in women and possibly in men remains an open question for future research, as does further exploration of the linguistic
cues to both self-deprecation and teasing.
For accommodation, we found effects, but not exactly where we predicted them. We found no effects of accommodation in friendly or ﬂirtatious speakers. On the other hand, we found strong effects of increased accommodation in
assertive women. For ﬂirting and friendly women we ﬁnd strong effects of accommodations not in their own speech
but in that of their partner. That is, men talking with friendly or ﬂirtatious women were more likely to accommodate to their words. Why accommodation might be a response to another’s ﬂirtation remains a subject for further
research.

113

Our work also has methodological implications, both for lexical and prosodic cues. Most previous work on the
extraction of social meaning has looked at classes of single words or simple disﬂuencies. Our work suggests that
detection of entire dialog acts (sympathy, appreciations, clariﬁcation questions) as well as lexical families such as
hedges, can help in meaning extraction. For prosody, much prior research has either focused on only one or two
prosodic features such as mean F0, or used a very large variety of prosodic features in a regression. The use of F0
alone obviously underdescribes the space, but the use of a large collection of features also has problems, especially
since prosodic features tend to be collinear. While the accuracy of regression and SVM classiﬁers are relatively robust
to collinear features, analysis of their feature weights are not. Here, we have adopted an inductive approach based on
factor analysis that reveals interpretable acoustic manipulations being done in the course of conversations. Our factors
suggest that minimum and maximum pitch are distinctly relevant for social meaning, while mean pitch is not, and min,
mean, and max intensity pattern together. These hypotheses can be tested in our further work.
The fact that the two interlocutors are often assigned the same stance suggests that stance is to a great extent a
property of the dyadic interaction rather than the individual, a result with important implications for the study of
interpersonal stance.
Finally, the references to self-deprecating and teasing actions above demonstrate how many speech acts are polysemous, deriving their meaning from their situation in sequence. Much prior work that relies solely on turn-internal
features like single words or prosody gives little recognition to the dynamic contextual nature of dialog meaning. To
advance our understanding of the linguistic realizations of social meaning we need to model more complex acts to
better represent the way resources like laughter, for example, can be used in both self-deprecating and other-deferring
ways. Our attempts to deﬁne acts such as sympathy, appreciations, or initial and medial laughter begin this process, but
future work must look at pair-wise ordering and other structures above the individual speech act to capture the nuances
of actions, demeaner displays, teasing, and the full richness of dialog maneuvers (Goffman, 1981). Another important
goal for future work is to take into count the joint inﬂuence of stances; if ﬂirtation and assertiveness are present in the
same conversation, for example, they will affect the distribution of features together. Some sort of joint estimation is
likely called for to disentangle the inﬂuences.
All of the results presented here should be regarded with some caution. The sample is small and not a random sample
of English speakers or American adults, and speed dating is not a natural context for expressing every conversational
style. A wider array of studies across populations and genres would be required before a more general theory of
conversational styles is established.
On the other hand, the presented results may under-reﬂect the relations being captured. The quality of recordings
and coarse granularity (1 s) of the time-stamps likely cloud the relations, and as the data is cleaned and improved, we
expect the associations to only grow stronger.
Caveats aside, we believe the evidence indicates that several types of interpersonal stance have linguistic signals,
mainly within gender but also to some extent across genders. Further investigation of these and other new variables
at the spectral, prosodic, lexical, grammatical, and discourse level can only help enrich our understanding of social
meaning and its linguistic realization, and move the ﬁeld toward automatic extraction of social meaning for social
computing applications.
