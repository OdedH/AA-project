Abstract
We describe a method for incorporating syntactic information in statistical machine translation systems. The ﬁrst step
of the method is to parse the source language string that is being translated. The second step is to apply a series of transformations to the parse tree, effectively reordering the surface
string on the source language side of the translation system. The
goal of this step is to recover an underlying word order that is
closer to the target language word-order than the original string.
The reordering approach is applied as a pre-processing step in
both the training and decoding phases of a phrase-based statistical MT system. We describe experiments on translation from
German to English, showing an improvement from 25.2% Bleu
score for a baseline system to 26.8% Bleu score for the system
with reordering, a statistically signiﬁcant improvement.

Introduction

Recent research on statistical machine translation
(SMT) has lead to the development of phrasebased systems (Och et al., 1999; Marcu and Wong,
2002; Koehn et al., 2003). These methods go beyond the original IBM machine translation models
(Brown et al., 1993), by allowing multi-word units
(“phrases”) in one language to be translated directly
into phrases in another language. A number of empirical evaluations have suggested that phrase-based
systems currently represent the state–of–the–art in
statistical machine translation.
In spite of their success, a key limitation of
phrase-based systems is that they make little or no
direct use of syntactic information. It appears likely
that syntactic information will be crucial in accurately modeling many phenomena during translation, for example systematic differences between the
word order of different languages. For this reason
there is currently a great deal of interest in methods which incorporate syntactic information within
statistical machine translation systems (e.g., see (Alshawi, 1996; Wu, 1997; Yamada and Knight, 2001;
Gildea, 2003; Melamed, 2004; Graehl and Knight,
2004; Och et al., 2004; Xia and McCord, 2004)).
In this paper we describe an approach for the use
of syntactic information within phrase-based SMT
systems. The approach constitutes a simple, direct

method for the incorporation of syntactic information in a phrase–based system, which we will show
leads to signiﬁcant improvements in translation accuracy. The ﬁrst step of the method is to parse the
source language string that is being translated. The
second step is to apply a series of transformations
to the resulting parse tree, effectively reordering the
surface string on the source language side of the
translation system. The goal of this step is to recover an underlying word order that is closer to the
target language word-order than the original string.
Finally, we apply a phrase-based system to the reordered string to give a translation into the target
language.
We describe experiments involving machine
translation from German to English. As an illustrative example of our method, consider the following
German sentence, together with a “translation” into
English that follows the original word order:
Original sentence: Ich werde Ihnen die entsprechenden Anmerkungen aushaendigen, damit Sie das eventuell bei der
Abstimmung uebernehmen koennen.
English translation: I will to you the corresponding comments
pass on, so that you them perhaps in the vote adopt can.

The German word order in this case is substantially different from the word order that would be
seen in English. As we will show later in this paper, translations of sentences of this type pose difﬁculties for phrase-based systems. In our approach
we reorder the constituents in a parse of the German
sentence to give the following word order, which is
much closer to the target English word order (words
which have been “moved” are underlined):
Reordered sentence: Ich werde aushaendigen Ihnen die
entsprechenden Anmerkungen, damit Sie koennen
uebernehmen das eventuell bei der Abstimmung.
English translation: I will pass on to you the corresponding
comments, so that you can adopt them perhaps in the vote.

We applied our approach to translation from German to English in the Europarl corpus. Source language sentences are reordered in test data, and also
in training data that is used by the underlying phrasebased system. Results using the method show an
improvement from 25.2% Bleu score to 26.8% Bleu
score (a statistically signiﬁcant improvement), using
a phrase-based system (Koehn et al., 2003) which
has been shown in the past to be a highly competitive SMT system.

Background

2.1
2.1.1

Previous Work
Research on Phrase-Based SMT

The original work on statistical machine translation was carried out by researchers at IBM (Brown
et al., 1993). More recently, phrase-based models
(Och et al., 1999; Marcu and Wong, 2002; Koehn
et al., 2003) have been proposed as a highly successful alternative to the IBM models. Phrase-based
models generalize the original IBM models by allowing multiple words in one language to correspond to multiple words in another language. For
example, we might have a translation entry specifying that I will in English is a likely translation for Ich
werde in German.
In this paper we use the phrase-based system
of (Koehn et al., 2003) as our underlying model.
This approach ﬁrst uses the original IBM models
to derive word-to-word alignments in the corpus
of example translations. Heuristics are then used
to grow these alignments to encompass phrase-tophrase pairs. The end result of the training process is
a lexicon of phrase-to-phrase pairs, with associated
costs or probabilities. In translation with the system, a beam search method with left-to-right search
is used to ﬁnd a high scoring translation for an input sentence. At each stage of the search, one or
more English words are added to the hypothesized
string, and one or more consecutive German words
are “absorbed” (i.e., marked as having already been
translated—note that each word is absorbed at most
once). Each step of this kind has a number of costs:
for example, the log probability of the phrase-tophrase correspondence involved, the log probability
from a language model, and some “distortion” score
indicating how likely it is for the proposed words in

the English string to be aligned to the corresponding
position in the German string.
2.1.2

Research on Syntax-Based SMT

A number of researchers (Alshawi, 1996; Wu,
1997; Yamada and Knight, 2001; Gildea, 2003;
Melamed, 2004; Graehl and Knight, 2004; Galley
et al., 2004) have proposed models where the translation process involves syntactic representations of
the source and/or target languages. One class of approaches make use of “bitext” grammars which simultaneously parse both the source and target languages. Another class of approaches make use of
syntactic information in the target language alone,
effectively transforming the translation problem into
a parsing problem. Note that these models have radically different structures and parameterizations from
phrase–based models for SMT. As yet, these systems have not shown signiﬁcant gains in accuracy
in comparison to phrase-based systems.
Reranking methods have also been proposed as a
method for using syntactic information (Koehn and
Knight, 2003; Och et al., 2004; Shen et al., 2004). In
these approaches a baseline system is used to generate N -best output. Syntactic features are then used
in a second model that reranks the N -best lists, in
an attempt to improve over the baseline approach.
(Koehn and Knight, 2003) apply a reranking approach to the sub-task of noun-phrase translation.
(Och et al., 2004; Shen et al., 2004) describe the
use of syntactic features in reranking the output of
a full translation system, but the syntactic features
give very small gains: for example the majority of
the gain in performance in the experiments in (Och
et al., 2004) was due to the addition of IBM Model
1 translation probabilities, a non-syntactic feature.
An alternative use of syntactic information is to
employ an existing statistical parsing model as a language model within an SMT system. See (Charniak
et al., 2003) for an approach of this form, which
shows improvements in accuracy over a baseline
system.
2.1.3

Research on Preprocessing Approaches

Our approach involves a preprocessing step,
where sentences in the language being translated are
modiﬁed before being passed to an existing phrasebased translation system. A number of other re-

searchers (Berger et al., 1996; Niessen and Ney,
2004; Xia and McCord, 2004) have described previous work on preprocessing methods. (Berger et al.,
1996) describe an approach that targets translation
of French phrases of the form NOUN de NOUN
(e.g., conﬂit d’int´ rˆ t). This was a relatively limee
ited study, concentrating on this one syntactic phenomenon which involves relatively local transformations (a parser was not required in this study).
(Niessen and Ney, 2004) describe a method that
combines morphologically–split verbs in German,
and also reorders questions in English and German.
Our method goes beyond this approach in several
respects, for example considering phenomena such
as declarative (non-question) clauses, subordinate
clauses, negation, and so on.
(Xia and McCord, 2004) describe an approach for
translation from French to English, where reordering rules are acquired automatically. The reordering rules in their approach operate at the level of
context-free rules in the parse tree. Our method
differs from that of (Xia and McCord, 2004) in a
couple of important respects. First, we are considering German, which arguably has more challenging word order phenonema than French. German
has relatively free word order, in contrast to both
English and French: for example, there is considerable ﬂexibility in terms of which phrases can appear in the ﬁrst position in a clause. Second, Xia
et. al’s (2004) use of reordering rules stated at the
context-free level differs from ours. As one example, in our approach we use a single transformation
that moves an inﬁnitival verb to the ﬁrst position in
a verb phrase. Xia et. al’s approach would require
learning of a different rule transformation for every
production of the form VP => .... In practice the
German parser that we are using creates relatively
“ﬂat” structures at the VP and clause levels, leading
to a huge number of context-free rules (the ﬂatness
is one consequence of the relatively free word order
seen within VP’s and clauses in German). There are
clearly some advantages to learning reordering rules
automatically, as in Xia et. al’s approach. However, we note that our approach involves a handful of linguistically–motivated transformations and
achieves comparable improvements (albeit on a different language pair) to Xia et. al’s method, which
in contrast involves over 56,000 transformations.

2.2

German Clause Structure

In this section we give a brief description of the syntactic structure of German clauses. The characteristics we describe motivate the reordering rules described later in the paper.
Figure 1 gives an example parse tree for a German
sentence. This sentence contains two clauses:
Clause 1: Ich/I werde/will Ihnen/to you die/the
entsprechenden/corresponding
Anmerkungen/comments aushaendigen/pass on
Clause 2: damit/so that Sie/you das/them
eventuell/perhaps bei/in der/the Abstimmung/vote
uebernehmen/adopt koennen/can
These two clauses illustrate a number of syntactic
phenomena in German which lead to quite different
word order from English:
Position of ﬁnite verbs. In Clause 1, which is a
matrix clause, the ﬁnite verb werde is in the second
position in the clause. Finite verbs appear rigidly in
2nd position in matrix clauses. In contrast, in subordinate clauses, such as Clause 2, the ﬁnite verb
comes last in the clause. For example, note that
koennen is a ﬁnite verb which is the ﬁnal element
of Clause 2.
Position of inﬁnitival verbs. In German, inﬁnitival verbs are ﬁnal within their associated verb

phrase. For example, returning to Figure 1, notice that aushaendigen is the last element in its verb
phrase, and that uebernehmen is the ﬁnal element of
its verb phrase in the ﬁgure.
Relatively ﬂexible word ordering. German has
substantially freer word order than English. In particular, note that while the verb comes second in matrix clauses, essentially any element can be in the
ﬁrst position. For example, in Clause 1, while the
subject Ich is seen in the ﬁrst position, potentially
any of the other constituents (e.g., Ihnen) could also
appear in this position. Note that this often leads
to the subject following the ﬁnite verb, something
which happens very rarely in English.
There are many other phenomena which lead to
differing word order between German and English.
Two others that we focus on in this paper are negation (the differing placement of items such as not in
English and nicht in German), and also verb-particle
constructions. We describe our treatment of these
phenomena later in this paper.
2.3 Reordering with Phrase-Based SMT
We have seen in the last section that German syntax
has several characteristics that lead to signiﬁcantly
different word order from that of English. We now
describe how these characteristics can lead to difﬁculties for phrase–based translation systems when
applied to German to English translation.
Typically, reordering models in phrase-based systems are based solely on movement distance. In particular, at each point in decoding a “cost” is associated with skipping over 1 or more German words.
For example, assume that in translating
Ich werde Ihnen die entsprechenden Anmerkungen aushaendigen.
we have reached a state where “Ich” and “werde”
have been translated into “I will” in English. A
potential decoding decision at this point is to add
the phrase “pass on” to the English hypothesis, at
the same time absorbing “aushaendigen” from the
German string. The cost of this decoding step
will involve a number of factors, including a cost
of skipping over a phrase of length 4 (i.e., Ihnen
die entsprechenden Anmerkungen) in the German
string.

The ability to penalise “skips” of this type, and
the potential to model multi-word phrases, are essentially the main strategies that the phrase-based
system is able to employ when modeling differing
word-order across different languages. In practice,
when training the parameters of an SMT system, for
example using the discriminative methods of (Och,
2003), the cost for skips of this kind is typically set
to a very high value. In experiments with the system of (Koehn et al., 2003) we have found that in
practice a large number of complete translations are
completely monotonic (i.e., have 0 skips), suggesting that the system has difﬁculty learning exactly
what points in the translation should allow reordering. In summary, phrase-based systems have relatively limited potential to model word-order differences between different languages.
The reordering stage described in this paper attempts to modify the source language (e.g., German)
in such a way that its word order is very similar to
that seen in the target language (e.g., English). In
an ideal approach, the resulting translation problem
that is passed on to the phrase-based system will be
solvable using a completely monotonic translation,
without any skips, and without requiring extremely
long phrases to be translated (for example a phrasal
translation corresponding to Ihnen die entsprechenden Anmerkungen aushaendigen).
Note than an additional beneﬁt of the reordering
phase is that it may bring together groups of words
in German which have a natural correspondence to
phrases in English, but were unseen or rare in the
original German text. For example, in the previous
example, we might derive a correspondence between
werde aushaendigen and will pass on that was not
possible before reordering. Another example concerns verb-particle constructions, for example in
Wir machen die Tuer auf
machen and auf form a verb-particle construction.
The reordering stage moves auf to precede machen,
allowing a phrasal entry that “auf machen” is translated to to open in English. Without the reordering,
the particle can be arbitrarily far from the verb that
it modiﬁes, and there is a danger in this example of
translating machen as to make, the natural translation when no particle is present.

Original sentence: Ich werde Ihnen die entsprechenden
Anmerkungen aushaendigen, damit Sie das eventuell bei
der Abstimmung uebernehmen koennen. (I will to you the
corresponding comments pass on, so that you them perhaps
in the vote adopt can.)

For example, in the subordinate clause in Figure 1, the head of the clause koennen would be
moved to follow the complementizer damit, giving
the following structure:

Reordered sentence: Ich werde aushaendigen Ihnen
die entsprechenden Anmerkungen, damit Sie koennen uebernehmen das eventuell bei der Abstimmung.
(I will pass on to you the corresponding comments, so that you
can adopt them perhaps in the vote.)

Clause Restructuring

We now describe the method we use for reordering
German sentences. As a ﬁrst step in the reordering
process, we parse the sentence using the parser described in (Dubey and Keller, 2003). The second
step is to apply a sequence of rules that reorder the
German sentence depending on the parse tree structure. See Figure 2 for an example German sentence
before and after the reordering step.
In the reordering phase, each of the following six
restructuring steps were applied to a German parse
tree, in sequence (see table 1 also, for examples of
the reordering steps):
[1] Verb initial In any verb phrase (i.e., phrase
with label VP-...) ﬁnd the head of the phrase (i.e.,
the child with label -HD) and move it into the initial position within the verb phrase. For example,
in the parse tree in Figure 1, aushaendigen would be
moved to precede Ihnen in the ﬁrst verb phrase (VPOC), and uebernehmen would be moved to precede
das in the second VP-OC. The subordinate clause
would have the following structure after this transformation:
S-MO KOUS-CP damit
PPER-SB Sie
VP-OC VVINF-HD uebernehmen
PDS-OA das
ADJD-MO eventuell
PP-MO APPR-DA bei
ART-DA der
NN-NK Abstimmung
VMFIN-HD koennen

[2] Verb 2nd In any subordinate clause labelled
S-..., with a complementizer KOUS, PREL, PWS
or PWAV, ﬁnd the head of the clause, and move it to
directly follow the complementizer.

[3] Move Subject For any clause (i.e., phrase with
label S...), move the subject to directly precede
the head. We deﬁne the subject to be the left-most
child of the clause with label ...-SB or PPEREP, and the head to be the leftmost child with label
...-HD.
For example, in the subordinate clause in Figure 1, the subject Sie would be moved to precede
koennen, giving the following structure:
S-MO KOUS-CP damit
PPER-SB Sie
VMFIN-HD koennen
VP-OC VVINF-HD uebernehmen
PDS-OA das
ADJD-MO eventuell
PP-MO APPR-DA bei
ART-DA der
NN-NK Abstimmung

[4] Particles In verb particle constructions, move
the particle to immediately precede the verb. More
speciﬁcally, if a ﬁnite verb (i.e., verb tagged as
VVFIN) and a particle (i.e., word tagged as PTKVZ)
are found in the same clause, move the particle to
precede the verb.
As one example, the following clause contains
both a verb (forden) as well as a particle (auf):
S PPER-SB
VVFIN-HD
NP-OA ART
NN
PTKVZ-SVP

Wir
fordern
das
Praesidium
auf

After the transformation, the clause is altered to:
S PPER-SB
PTKVZ-SVP
VVFIN-HD
NP-OA ART
NN

Wir
auf
fordern
das
Praesidium

Table 1: Examples for each of the reordering steps. In each case the item that is moved is underlined.
[5] Inﬁnitives In some cases, inﬁnitival verbs are
still not in the correct position after transformations
[1]–[4]. For this reason we add a second step that
involves inﬁnitives. First, we remove all internal VP
nodes within the parse tree. Second, for any clause
(i.e., phrase labeled S...), if the clause dominates
both a ﬁnite and inﬁnitival verb, and there is an argument (i.e., a subject, or an object) between the two
verbs, then the inﬁnitive is moved to directly follow
the ﬁnite verb.
As an example, the following clause contains an
inﬁnitival (einreichen) that is separated from a ﬁnite
verb konnten by the direct object es:
S PPER-SB Wir
VMFIN-HD konnten
PPER-OA es
PTKNEG-NG nicht
VP-OC VVINF-HD einreichen
AP-MO ADV-MO mehr
ADJD-HD rechtzeitig

The transformation removes the VP-OC, and
moves the inﬁnitive, giving:
S PPER-SB Wir
VMFIN-HD konnten
VVINF-HD einreichen
PPER-OA es
PTKNEG-NG nicht
AP-MO ADV-MO mehr
ADJD-HD rechtzeitig

[6] Negation As a ﬁnal step, we move negative
particles. If a clause dominates both a ﬁnite and inﬁnitival verb, as well as a negative particle (i.e., a
word tagged as PTKNEG), then the negative particle
is moved to directly follow the ﬁnite verb.
As an example, the previous example now has the
negative particle nicht moved, to give the following
clause structure:
S PPER-SB Wir
VMFIN-HD konnten
PTKNEG-NG nicht
VVINF-HD einreichen
PPER-OA es
AP-MO ADV-MO mehr
ADJD-HD rechtzeitig

Experiments

This section describes experiments with the reordering approach. Our baseline is the phrase-based
MT system of (Koehn et al., 2003). We trained
this system on the Europarl corpus, which consists
of 751,088 sentence pairs with 15,256,792 German
words and 16,052,269 English words. Translation
performance is measured on a 2000 sentence test set
from a different part of the Europarl corpus, with average sentence length of 28 words.
We use BLEU scores (Papineni et al., 2002) to
measure translation accuracy. We applied our re-

ordering method to both the training and test data,
and retrained the system on the reordered training
data. The BLEU score for the new system was
26.8%, an improvement from 25.2% BLEU for the
baseline system.
4.1 Human Translation Judgements
We also used human judgements of translation quality to evaluate the effectiveness of the reordering
rules. We randomly selected 100 sentences from the
test corpus where the English reference translation
was between 10 and 20 words in length.1 For each
of these 100 translations, we presented the two annotators with three translations: the reference (human)
translation, the output from the baseline system, and
the output from the system with reordering. No indication was given as to which system was the baseline system, and the ordering in which the baseline
and reordered translations were presented was chosen at random on each example, to prevent ordering
effects in the annotators’ judgements. For each example, we asked each of the annotators to make one
of two choices: 1) an indication that one translation
was an improvement over the other; or 2) an indication that the translations were of equal quality.
Annotator 1 judged 40 translations to be improved
by the reordered model; 40 translations to be of
equal quality; and 20 translations to be worse under
the reordered model. Annotator 2 judged 44 translations to be improved by the reordered model; 37
translations to be of equal quality; and 19 translations to be worse under the reordered model. Table 2 gives ﬁgures indicating agreement rates between the annotators. Note that if we only consider
preferences where both annotators were in agree1
We chose these shorter sentences for human evaluation because in general they include a single clause, which makes human judgements relatively straightforward.

ment (and consider all disagreements to fall into the
“equal” category), then 33 translations improved under the reordering system, and 13 translations became worse. Figure 3 shows a random selection
of the translations where annotator 1 judged the reordered model to give an improvement; Figure 4
shows examples where the baseline system was preferred by annotator 1. We include these examples to
give a qualitative impression of the differences between the baseline and reordered system. Our (no
doubt subjective) impression is that the cases in ﬁgure 3 are more clear cut instances of translation improvements, but we leave the reader to make his/her
own judgement on this point.
4.2

Statistical Signiﬁcance

We now describe statistical signiﬁcance tests for our
results. We believe that applying signiﬁcance tests
to Bleu scores is a subtle issue, for this reason we go
into some detail in this section.
We used the sign test (e.g., see page 166 of
(Lehmann, 1986)) to test the statistical signiﬁcance
of our results. For a source sentence X, the sign test
requires a function f (X) that is deﬁned as follows:

f (X) =


 +







−






 =



If reordered system produces a better
translation for X than the baseline
If baseline produces a better translation
for X than the reordered system.
If the two systems produce equal
quality translations on X

We assume that sentences X are drawn from
some underlying distribution P (X), and that the test
set consists of independently, identically distributed
(IID) sentences from this distribution. We can deﬁne
the following probabilities:
p+ = Probability(f (X) = +)

(1)

p− = Probability(f (X) = −)

(2)

where the probability is taken with respect to the
distribution P (X). The sign test has the null hypothesis H0 = {p+ ≤ p− } and the alternative
hypothesis H1 = {p+ > p− }. Given a sample of n test points {X1 , . . . , Xn }, the sign test
depends on calculation of the following counts:
c+ = |{i : f (Xi ) = +}|, c− = |{i : f (Xi ) = −}|,

and c0 = |{i : f (Xi ) = 0}|, where |S| is the cardinality of the set S.
We now come to the deﬁnition of f (X) — how
should we judge whether a translation from one system is better or worse than the translation from another system? A critical problem with Bleu scores is
that they are a function of an entire test corpus and
do not give translation scores for single sentences.
Ideally we would have some measure fR (X) ∈ R
of the quality of the translation of sentence X under the reordered system, and a corresponding function fB (X) that measures the quality of the baseline
translation. We could then deﬁne f (X) as follows:
f (X) = +
f (X) = −
f (X) = 0

If fR (X) > fB (X)
If fR (X) < fB (X)
If fR (X) = fB (X)

Unfortunately Bleu scores do not give persentence measures fR (X) and fB (X), and thus do
not allow a deﬁnition of f (X) in this way. In general
the lack of per-sentence scores makes it challenging
to apply signiﬁcance tests to Bleu scores.2
To get around this problem, we make the following approximation. For any test sentence Xi , we calculate f (Xi ) as follows. First, we deﬁne s to be the
Bleu score for the test corpus when translated by the
baseline model. Next, we deﬁne si to be the Bleu
score when all sentences other than Xi are translated
by the baseline model, and where Xi itself is translated by the reordered model. We then deﬁne
f (Xi ) = +
f (Xi ) = −
f (Xi ) = 0

If si > s
If si < s
If si = s

Note that strictly speaking, this deﬁnition of f (Xi )
is not valid, as it depends on the entire set of sample
points X1 . . . Xn rather than Xi alone. However, we
believe it is a reasonable approximation to an ideal

The lack of per-sentence scores means that it is not possible
to apply standard statistical tests such as the sign test or the ttest (which would test the hypothesis E[fR (X)] > E[fB (X)],
where E[.] is the expected value under X). Note that previous
work (Koehn, 2004; Zhang and Vogel, 2004) has suggested the
use of bootstrap tests (Efron and Tibshirani, 1993) for the calculation of conﬁdence intervals for Bleu scores. (Koehn, 2004)
gives empirical evidence that these give accurate estimates for
Bleu statistics. However, correctness of the bootstrap method
relies on some technical properties of the statistic (e.g., Bleu
scores) being used (e.g., see (Wasserman, 2004) theorem 8.3);
(Koehn, 2004; Zhang and Vogel, 2004) do not discuss whether
Bleu scores meet any such criteria, which makes us uncertain of
their correctness when applied to Bleu scores.

function f (X) that indicates whether the translations have improved or not under the reordered system. Given this deﬁnition of f (X), we found that
c+ = 1057, c− = 728, and c0 = 215. (Thus 52.85%
of all test sentences had improved translations under the baseline system, 36.4% of all sentences had
worse translations, and 10.75% of all sentences had
the same quality as before.) If our deﬁnition of f (X)
was correct, these values for c+ and c− would be
signiﬁcant at the level p ≤ 0.01.
We can also calculate conﬁdence intervals for the
results. Deﬁne P to be the probability that the reordered system improves on the baseline system,
given that the two systems do not have equal performance. The relative frequency estimate of P is
ˆ
P = 1057/(1057 + 728) = 59.2%. Using a normal approximation (e.g., see Example 6.17 from
(Wasserman, 2004)) a 95% conﬁdence interval for
ˆ
a sample size of 1785 is P ± 2.3%, giving a 95%
conﬁdence interval of [56.9%, 61.5%] for P .

Conclusions

We have demonstrated that adding knowledge about
syntactic structure can signiﬁcantly improve the performance of an existing state-of-the-art statistical
machine translation system. Our approach makes
use of syntactic knowledge to overcome a weakness
of tradition SMT systems, namely long-distance reordering. We pose clause restructuring as a problem for machine translation. Our current approach
is based on hand-crafted rules, which are based on
our linguistic knowledge of how German and English syntax differs. In the future we may investigate
data-driven approaches, in an effort to learn reordering models automatically. While our experiments
are on German, other languages have word orders
that are very different from English, so we believe
our methods will be generally applicable.
