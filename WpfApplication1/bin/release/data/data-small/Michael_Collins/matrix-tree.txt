Abstract
This paper provides an algorithmic framework for learning statistical models involving directed spanning trees, or equivalently
non-projective dependency structures. We
show how partition functions and marginals
for directed spanning trees can be computed
by an adaptation of Kirchhoff’s Matrix-Tree
Theorem. To demonstrate an application of
the method, we perform experiments which
use the algorithm in training both log-linear
and max-margin dependency parsers. The
new training methods give improvements in
accuracy over perceptron-trained models.

Introduction

Learning with structured data typically involves
searching or summing over a set with an exponential number of structured elements, for example the
set of all parse trees for a given sentence. Methods for summing over such structures include the
inside-outside algorithm for probabilistic contextfree grammars (Baker, 1979), the forward-backward
algorithm for hidden Markov models (Baum et
al., 1970), and the belief-propagation algorithm for
graphical models (Pearl, 1988). These algorithms
compute marginal probabilities and partition functions, quantities which are central to many methods for the statistical modeling of complex structures (e.g., the EM algorithm (Baker, 1979; Baum
et al., 1970), contrastive estimation (Smith and Eisner, 2005), training algorithms for CRFs (Lafferty et
al., 2001), and training algorithms for max-margin
models (Bartlett et al., 2004; Taskar et al., 2004a)).
This paper describes inside-outside-style algorithms for the case of directed spanning trees. These
structures are equivalent to non-projective dependency parses (McDonald et al., 2005b), and more
generally could be relevant to any task that involves
learning a mapping from a graph to an underlying

spanning tree. Unlike the case for projective dependency structures, partition functions and marginals
for non-projective trees cannot be computed using
dynamic-programming methods such as the insideoutside algorithm. In this paper we describe how
these quantities can be computed by adapting a wellknown result in graph theory: Kirchhoff’s MatrixTree Theorem (Tutte, 1984). A na¨ve application of
ı
4 ) and O(n6 ) algorithms for
the theorem yields O(n
computation of the partition function and marginals,
respectively. However, our adaptation ﬁnds the partition function and marginals in O(n3 ) time using
simple matrix determinant and inversion operations.
We demonstrate an application of the new inference algorithm to non-projective dependency parsing. Speciﬁcally, we show how to implement
two popular supervised learning approaches for this
task: globally-normalized log-linear models and
max-margin models. Log-linear estimation critically depends on the calculation of partition functions and marginals, which can be computed by
our algorithms. For max-margin models, Bartlett
et al. (2004) have provided a simple training algorithm, based on exponentiated-gradient (EG) updates, that requires computation of marginals and
can thus be implemented within our framework.
Both of these methods explicitly minimize the loss
incurred when parsing the entire training set. This
contrasts with the online learning algorithms used in
previous work with spanning-tree models (McDonald et al., 2005b).
We applied the above two marginal-based training algorithms to six languages with varying degrees of non-projectivity, using datasets obtained
from the CoNLL-X shared task (Buchholz and
Marsi, 2006). Our experimental framework compared three training approaches: log-linear models,
max-margin models, and the averaged perceptron.
Each of these was applied to both projective and
non-projective parsing. Our results demonstrate that
marginal-based training yields models which out-

Projective

perform those trained using the averaged perceptron.
In summary, the contributions of this paper are:
1. We introduce algorithms for inside-outsidestyle calculations for directed spanning trees, or
equivalently non-projective dependency structures. These algorithms should have wide
applicability in learning problems involving
spanning-tree structures.

2. We illustrate the utility of these algorithms in
log-linear training of dependency parsing models, and show improvements in accuracy when
compared to averaged-perceptron training.
3. We also train max-margin models for dependency parsing via an EG algorithm (Bartlett
et al., 2004). The experiments presented here
constitute the ﬁrst application of this algorithm
to a large-scale problem. We again show improved performance over the perceptron.
The goal of our experiments is to give a rigorous
comparative study of the marginal-based training algorithms and a highly-competitive baseline, the averaged perceptron, using the same feature sets for
all approaches. We stress, however, that the purpose
of this work is not to give competitive performance
on the CoNLL data sets; this would require further
engineering of the approach.
Similar adaptations of the Matrix-Tree Theorem
have been developed independently and simultaneously by Smith and Smith (2007) and McDonald and
Satta (2007); see Section 5 for more discussion.

2.1

Background
Discriminative Dependency Parsing

Dependency parsing is the task of mapping a sentence x to a dependency structure y. Given a sentence x with n words, a dependency for that sentence is a tuple (h, m) where h ∈ [0 . . . n] is the
index of the head word in the sentence, and m ∈
[1 . . . n] is the index of a modiﬁer word. The value
h = 0 is a special root-symbol that may only appear as the head of a dependency. We use D(x) to
refer to all possible dependencies for a sentence x:
D(x) = {(h, m) : h ∈ [0 . . . n], m ∈ [1 . . . n]}.
A dependency parse is a set of dependencies
that forms a directed tree, with the sentence’s rootsymbol as its root. We will consider both projective

trees, where dependencies are not allowed to cross,
and non-projective trees, where crossing dependencies are allowed. Dependency annotations for some
languages, for example Czech, can exhibit a signiﬁcant number of crossing dependencies. In addition,
we consider both single-root and multi-root trees. In
a single-root tree y, the root-symbol has exactly one
child, while in a multi-root tree, the root-symbol has
one or more children. This distinction is relevant
as our training sets include both single-root corpora
(in which all trees are single-root structures) and
multi-root corpora (in which some trees are multiroot structures).
The two distinctions described above are orthogonal, yielding four classes of dependency structures;
see Figure 1 for examples of each kind of structure.
We use Tps (x) to denote the set of all possible projective single-root dependency structures for a sens
tence x, and Tnp (x) to denote the set of single-root
non-projective structures for x. The sets Tpm (x) and
m
Tnp (x) are deﬁned analogously for multi-root structures. In contexts where any class of dependency
structures may be used, we use the notation T (x) as
s
a placeholder that may be deﬁned as Tps (x), Tnp (x),
m
Tpm (x) or Tnp (x).
Following McDonald et al. (2005a), we use a discriminative model for dependency parsing. Features in the model are deﬁned through a function
f (x, h, m) which maps a sentence x together with
a dependency (h, m) to a feature vector in Rd . A
feature vector can be sensitive to any properties of
the triple (x, h, m). Given a parameter vector w,
the optimal dependency structure for a sentence x is
y ∗ (x; w) = argmax

w · f (x, h, m) (1)

y∈T (x) (h,m)∈y
s
where the set T (x) can be deﬁned as Tps (x), Tnp (x),
m
Tpm (x) or Tnp (x), depending on the type of parsing.

The parameters w will be learned from a training set {(xi , yi )}N where each xi is a sentence and
i=1
each yi is a dependency structure. Much of the previous work on learning w has focused on training local models (see Section 5). McDonald et al. (2005a;
2005b) trained global models using online algorithms such as the perceptron algorithm or MIRA.
In this paper we consider training algorithms based
on work in conditional random ﬁelds (CRFs) (Lafferty et al., 2001) and max-margin methods (Taskar
et al., 2004a).
2.2

Three Inference Problems

This section highlights three inference problems
which arise in training and decoding discriminative
dependency parsers, and which are central to the approaches described in this paper.
Assume that we have a vector θ with values
θh,m ∈ R for all (h, m) ∈ D(x); these values correspond to weights on the different dependencies in
D(x). Deﬁne a conditional distribution over all dependency structures y ∈ T (x) as follows:
exp
P (y | x; θ) =

(h,m)∈y θh,m

(2)

Z(x; θ)

Z(x; θ) =

exp
y∈T (x)




θh,m



(h,m)∈y




(3)



The function Z(x; θ) is commonly referred to as the
partition function.
Given the distribution P (y | x; θ), we can deﬁne
the marginal probability of a dependency (h, m) as
P (y | x; θ)

µh,m (x; θ) =
y∈T (x) : (h,m)∈y

The inference problems are then as follows:
Problem 1: Decoding:
Find argmaxy∈T (x)

being able to solve Problem 1: by setting θh,m =
w · f (x, h, m), the optimal dependency structure
y ∗ (x; w) (see Eq. 1) can be computed. In this paper
the motivation for solving Problems 2 and 3 arises
from training algorithms for discriminative models.
As we will describe in Section 4, both log-linear and
max-margin models can be trained via methods that
make direct use of algorithms for Problems 2 and 3.
In the case of projective dependency structures
(i.e., T (x) deﬁned as Tps (x) or Tpm (x)), there are
well-known algorithms for all three inference problems. Decoding can be carried out using Viterbistyle dynamic-programming algorithms, for example the O(n3 ) algorithm of Eisner (1996). Computation of the marginals and partition function can
also be achieved in O(n3 ) time, using a variant of
the inside-outside algorithm (Baker, 1979) applied
to the Eisner (1996) data structures (Paskin, 2001).
In the non-projective case (i.e., T (x) deﬁned as
m
s
Tnp (x) or Tnp (x)), McDonald et al. (2005b) describe how the CLE algorithm (Chu and Liu, 1965;
Edmonds, 1967) can be used for decoding. However, it is not possible to compute the marginals
and partition function using the inside-outside algorithm. We next describe a method for computing
these quantities in O(n3 ) time using matrix inverse
and determinant operations.

Problem 2: Computation of the Partition Function: Calculate Z(x; θ).
Problem 3: Computation of the Marginals:
For all (h, m) ∈ D(x), calculate µh,m (x; θ).
Note that all three problems require a maximization or summation over the set T (x), which is exponential in size. There is a clear motivation for

Spanning-tree inference using the
Matrix-Tree Theorem

In this section we present algorithms for computing
the partition function and marginals, as deﬁned in
Section 2.2, for non-projective parsing. We ﬁrst reiterate the observation of McDonald et al. (2005a)
that non-projective parses correspond to directed
spanning trees on a complete directed graph of n
nodes, where n is the length of the sentence. The
above inference problems thus involve summation
over the set of all directed spanning trees. Note that
this set is exponentially large, and there is no obvious method for decomposing the sum into dynamicprogramming-like subproblems. This section describes how a variant of Kirchhoff’s Matrix-Tree
Theorem (Tutte, 1984) can be used to evaluate the
partition function and marginals efﬁciently.
In what follows, we consider the single-root sets
ting (i.e., T (x) = Tnp (x)), leaving the multi-root

m
case (i.e., T (x) = Tnp (x)) to Section 3.3. For a
sentence x with n words, deﬁne a complete directed
graph G on n nodes, where each node corresponds
to a word in x, and each edge corresponds to a dependency between two words in x. Note that G does
not include the root-symbol h = 0, nor does it account for any dependencies (0, m) headed by the
root-symbol. We assign non-negative weights to the
edges of this graph, yielding the following weighted
adjacency matrix A(θ) ∈ Rn×n , for h, m = 1 . . . n:

Ah,m (θ) =

∀h, m: (−1)h+m L(h,m) (θ) = L(m,m) (θ)

0,
if h = m
exp {θh,m } , otherwise

3.1

To account for the dependencies (0, m) headed by
the root-symbol, we deﬁne a vector of root-selection
scores r(θ) ∈ Rn , for m = 1 . . . n:
rm (θ) = exp {θ0,m }
Let the weight of a dependency structure y ∈
be deﬁned as:

determinant of the matrix formed by deleting row h
and column m from X. Finally, deﬁne the weight of
any directed spanning tree of G to be the product of
the weights Ah,m (θ) for the edges in that tree.
Theorem 1 (Tutte, 1984, p. 140). Let L(θ) be the
Laplacian matrix of G. Then L(m,m) (θ) is equal to
the sum of the weights of all directed spanning trees
of G which are rooted at m. Furthermore, the minors vary only in sign when traversing the columns
of the Laplacian (Tutte, 1984, p. 150):

Partition functions via matrix determinants

From Theorem 1, it directly follows that
L(m,m) (θ) =

Ah,m (θ)
y∈U (m) (h,m)∈y : h=0

where U(m) = {y ∈ Tnp : root(y) = m}. A

ψ(y; θ) = rroot(y) (θ)

Z(θ) =

(h,m)∈y : h=0

m=1

Here, root(y) = m : (0, m) ∈ y is the child of the
root-symbol; there is exactly one such child, since
s
y ∈ Tnp (x). Eq. 2 and 3 can be rephrased as:
P (y | x; θ) =

ψ(y; θ)
Z(x; θ)

Z(x; θ) =

ψ(y; θ)

y∈Tnp (x)

In the remainder of this section, we drop the notational dependence on x for brevity.
The original Matrix-Tree Theorem addressed the
problem of counting the number of undirected spanning trees in an undirected graph. For the models
we study here, we require a sum of weighted and
directed spanning trees. Tutte (1984) extended the
Matrix-Tree Theorem to this case. We brieﬂy summarize his method below.
First, deﬁne the Laplacian matrix L(θ) ∈ Rn×n
of G, for h, m = 1 . . . n:
Lh,m (θ) =

n
h =1 Ah ,m (θ)

−Ah,m (θ)
X (h,m)

if h = m
otherwise

Second, for a matrix X, let
be the minor of
X with respect to row h and column m; i.e., the

The above would require calculating n determinants,
resulting in O(n4 ) complexity. However, as we
show below Z(θ) may be obtained in O(n3 ) time
using a single determinant evaluation.
ˆ
Deﬁne a new matrix L(θ) to be L(θ) with the ﬁrst
row replaced by the root-selection scores:
ˆ
Lh,m (θ) =

rm (θ)
h=1
Lh,m (θ) h > 1

This matrix allows direct computation of the partition function, as the following proposition shows.
Proposition 1 The partition function in Eq. 5 is
ˆ
given by Z(θ) = |L(θ)|.
ˆ
Proof: Consider the row expansion of |L(θ)| with
respect to row 1:

The second line follows from the construction of

L(θ), and the third line follows from Eq. 6.

3.2

Marginals via matrix inversion

The marginals we require are given by
1
Z(θ) y∈T s

µh,m (θ) =

np

ψ(y; θ)
: (h,m)∈y

To calculate these marginals efﬁciently for all values
of (h, m) we use a well-known identity relating the
log partition-function to marginals
µh,m (θ) =

∂ log Z(θ)
∂θh,m

Since the partition function in this case has a closedform expression (i.e., the determinant of a matrix
constructed from θ), the marginals can also obtained
in closed form. Using the chain rule, the derivative
of the log partition-function in Proposition 1 is
µh,m (θ) =

n

ˆ
ˆ
∂ log |L(θ)| ∂ Lh ,m (θ)
ˆ
∂θh,m
h =1 m =1 ∂ Lh ,m (θ)

To perform the derivative, we use the identity
∂ log |X|
=
∂X

X −1

T

ˆ
and the fact that ∂ Lh ,m (θ)/∂θh,m is nonzero for
only a few h , m . Speciﬁcally, when h = 0, the
marginals are given by
ˆ
µ0,m (θ) = rm (θ) L−1 (θ)

where diag(v) is the diagonal matrix with the vector
v on its diagonal.

ˆ
µh,m (θ) = (1 − δ1,m )Ah,m (θ) L−1 (θ)
ˆ
(1 − δh,1 )Ah,m (θ) L−1 (θ)

Labeled Trees

The techniques above extend easily to the case
where dependencies are labeled. For a model with
L different labels, it sufﬁces to deﬁne the edge
and root scores as Ah,m (θ) = L exp {θh,m, }
=1
and rm (θ) = L exp {θ0,m, }. The partition
=1
function over labeled trees is obtained by operating on these values as described previously, and
the marginals are given by an application of the
chain rule. Both inference problems are solvable in
O(n3 + Ln2 ) time.

estimation that rely explicitly on the computation of
the partition function and marginals.

where δh,m is the Kronecker delta. Thus, the complexity of evaluating all the relevant marginals is

complexity is therefore O(n3 ).

which augments G with a dummy root node that has
edges pointing to all of the existing nodes, weighted
by the appropriate root-selection scores. Note that
there is a bijection between directed spanning trees
of G rooted at the dummy root and multi-root strucm
tures y ∈ Tnp (x). Thus, Theorem 1 can be used to
compute the partition function directly: construct a
Laplacian matrix L(θ) for G and compute the minor L(0,0) (θ). Since this minor is also a determinant, the marginals can be obtained analogously to
the single-root case. More concretely, this technique
ˆ
corresponds to deﬁning the matrix L(θ) as

Multiple Roots

In the case of multiple roots, we can still compute
the partition function and marginals efﬁciently. In
fact, the derivation of this case is simpler than for
single-root structures. Create an extended graph G

4.1

Log-Linear Estimation

In conditional log-linear models (Johnson et al.,
1999; Lafferty et al., 2001), a distribution over parse
trees for a sentence x is deﬁned as follows:
exp
P (y | x; w) =

(h,m)∈y

w · f (x, h, m)

Z(x; w)

(7)

where Z(x; w) is the partition function, a sum over
s
m
Tps (x), Tnp (x), Tpm (x) or Tnp (x).
We train the model using the approach described
by Sha and Pereira (2003). Assume that we have a
training set {(xi , yi )}N . The optimal parameters
i=1

are taken to be w∗ = argminw L(w) where
N

L(w) = −C

1
log P (yi | xi ; w) + ||w||2
2
i=1

The parameter C > 0 is a constant dictating the level
of regularization in the model.
Since L(w) is a convex function, gradient descent methods can be used to search for the global
minimum. Such methods typically involve repeated
computation of the loss L(w) and gradient ∂L(w) ,
∂w
requiring efﬁcient implementations of both functions. Note that the log-probability of a parse is
log P (y | x; w) =

w · f (x, h, m) − log Z(x; w)

(h,m)∈y

so that the main issue in calculating the loss function L(w) is the evaluation of the partition functions
Z(xi ; w). The gradient of the loss is given by
∂L(w)
∂w

N

= w−C

f (xi , h, m)
i=1 (h,m)∈yi

N

+C

µh,m (xi ; w)f (xi , h, m)
i=1 (h,m)∈D(xi )

where
P (y | x; w)

µh,m (x; w) =
y∈T (x) : (h,m)∈y

is the marginal probability of a dependency (h, m).
Thus, the main issue in the evaluation of the gradient
is the computation of the marginals µh,m (xi ; w).
Note that Eq. 7 forms a special case of the loglinear distribution deﬁned in Eq. 2 in Section 2.2.
If we set θh,m = w · f (x, h, m) then we have
P (y | x; w) = P (y | x; θ), Z(x; w) = Z(x; θ), and
µh,m (x; w) = µh,m (x; θ). Thus in the projective
case the inside-outside algorithm can be used to calculate the partition function and marginals, thereby
enabling training of a log-linear model; in the nonprojective case the algorithms in Section 3 can be
used for this purpose.
4.2

Max-Margin Estimation

The second learning algorithm we consider is
the large-margin approach for structured prediction
(Taskar et al., 2004a; Taskar et al., 2004b). Learning
in this framework again involves minimization of a

convex function L(w). Let the margin for parse tree
y on the i’th training example be deﬁned as
w·f (xi , h, m) −

mi,y (w) =

(h,m)∈yi

w·f (xi , h, m)

(h,m)∈y

The loss function is then deﬁned as
N

L(w) = C

1
max (Ei,y − mi,y (w)) + ||w||2
2
y∈T (xi )
i=1

where Ei,y is a measure of the loss—or number of
errors—for parse y on the i’th training sentence. In
this paper we take Ei,y to be the number of incorrect
dependencies in the parse tree y when compared to
the gold-standard parse tree yi .
The deﬁnition of L(w) makes use of the expression maxy∈T (xi ) (Ei,y − mi,y (w)) for the i’th training example, which is commonly referred to as the
hinge loss. Note that Ei,yi = 0, and also that
mi,yi (w) = 0, so that the hinge loss is always nonnegative. In addition, the hinge loss is 0 if and only
if mi,y (w) ≥ Ei,y for all y ∈ T (xi ). Thus the hinge
loss directly penalizes margins mi,y (w) which are
less than their corresponding losses Ei,y .
Figure 2 shows an algorithm for minimizing
L(w) that is based on the exponentiated-gradient algorithm for large-margin optimization described by
Bartlett et al. (2004). The algorithm maintains a set
of weights θi,h,m for i = 1 . . . N, (h, m) ∈ D(xi ),
which are updated example-by-example. The algorithm relies on the repeated computation of marginal
values µi,h,m , which are deﬁned as follows:1
P (y | xi )

µi,h,m =

(8)

y∈T (xi ) : (h,m)∈y

exp
P (y | xi ) =

(h,m)∈y θi,h,m

y ∈T (xi ) exp

(h,m)∈y

θi,h,m

A similar deﬁnition is used to derive marginal values µi,h,m from the values θi,h,m . Computation of
the µ and µ values is again inference of the form
described in Problem 3 in Section 2.2, and can be
1

Bartlett et al. (2004) write P (y | xi ) as αi,y . The αi,y variables are dual variables that appear in the dual objective function, i.e., the convex dual of L(w). Analysis of the algorithm
shows that as the θi,h,m variables are updated, the dual variables converge to the optimal point of the dual objective, and
the parameters w converge to the minimum of L(w).

A similar QP dual may be obtained for max-margin
projective dependency parsing. However, for nonprojective parsing, the dual QP would require an exponential number of constraints on the dependency
marginals (Chopra, 1989). Nevertheless, alternative
optimization methods like that of Tsochantaridis et
al. (2004), or the EG method presented here, can still
be applied.
The majority of previous work on dependency
parsing has focused on local (i.e., classiﬁcation of
individual edges) discriminative training methods
(Yamada and Matsumoto, 2003; Nivre et al., 2004;
Y. Cheng, 2005). Non-local (i.e., classiﬁcation of
entire trees) training methods were used by McDonald et al. (2005a), who employed online learning.
Dependency parsing accuracy can be improved
by allowing second-order features, which consider
more than one dependency simultaneously. McDonald and Pereira (2006) deﬁne a second-order dependency parsing model in which interactions between
adjacent siblings are allowed, and Carreras (2007)
deﬁnes a second-order model that allows grandparent and sibling interactions. Both authors give polytime algorithms for exact projective parsing. By
adapting the inside-outside algorithm to these models, partition functions and marginals can be computed for second-order projective structures, allowing log-linear and max-margin training to be applied via the framework developed in this paper.
For higher-order non-projective parsing, however,
computational complexity results (McDonald and
Pereira, 2006; McDonald and Satta, 2007) indicate
that exact solutions to the three inference problems
of Section 2.2 will be intractable. Exploration of approximate second-order non-projective inference is
a natural avenue for future research.
Two other groups of authors have independently
and simultaneously proposed adaptations of the
Matrix-Tree Theorem for structured inference on directed spanning trees (McDonald and Satta, 2007;
Smith and Smith, 2007). There are some algorithmic
differences between these papers and ours. First, we
deﬁne both multi-root and single-root algorithms,
whereas the other papers only consider multi-root

parsing. This distinction can be important as one
often expects a dependency structure to have exactly one child attached to the root-symbol, as is the
case in a single-root structure. Second, McDonald
and Satta (2007) propose an O(n5 ) algorithm for
computing the marginals, as opposed to the O(n3 )
matrix-inversion approach used by Smith and Smith
(2007) and ourselves.
In addition to the algorithmic differences, both
groups of authors consider applications of the
Matrix-Tree Theorem which we have not discussed.
For example, both papers propose minimum-risk
decoding, and McDonald and Satta (2007) discuss unsupervised learning and language modeling, while Smith and Smith (2007) deﬁne hiddenvariable models based on spanning trees.
In this paper we used EG training methods only
for max-margin models (Bartlett et al., 2004). However, Globerson et al. (2007) have recently shown
how EG updates can be applied to efﬁcient training
of log-linear models.

Experiments on Dependency Parsing

In this section, we present experimental results
applying our inference algorithms for dependency
parsing models. Our primary purpose is to establish comparisons along two relevant dimensions:
projective training vs. non-projective training, and
marginal-based training algorithms vs. the averaged
perceptron. The feature representation and other relevant dimensions are kept ﬁxed in the experiments.
6.1

Data Sets and Features

We used data from the CoNLL-X shared task
on multilingual dependency parsing (Buchholz and
Marsi, 2006). In our experiments, we used a subset
consisting of six languages; Table 1 gives details of
the data sets used.2 For each language we created
a validation set that was a subset of the CoNLL-X
2

Our subset includes the two languages with the lowest accuracy in the CoNLL-X evaluations (Turkish and Arabic), the
language with the highest accuracy (Japanese), the most nonprojective language (Dutch), a moderately non-projective language (Slovene), and a highly projective language (Spanish).
All languages but Spanish have multi-root parses in their data.
We are grateful to the providers of the treebanks that constituted
the data of our experiments (Hajiˇ et al., 2004; van der Beek et
c
al., 2002; Kawata and Bartels, 2000; Dˇ eroski et al., 2006; Civit

and Mart´, 2002; Oﬂazer et al., 2003).

training set for that language. The remainder of each
training set was used to train the models for the different languages. The validation sets were used to
tune the meta-parameters (e.g., the value of the regularization constant C) of the different training algorithms. We used the ofﬁcial test sets and evaluation
script from the CoNLL-X task. All of the results that
we report are for unlabeled dependency parsing.3
The non-projective models were trained on the
CoNLL-X data in its original form. Since the projective models assume that the dependencies in the
data are non-crossing, we created a second training set for each language where non-projective dependency structures were automatically transformed
into projective structures. All projective models
were trained on these new training sets.4 Our feature
space is based on that of McDonald et al. (2005a).5
6.2

Results

We performed experiments using three training algorithms: the averaged perceptron (Collins, 2002),
log-linear training (via conjugate gradient descent),
and max-margin training (via the EG algorithm).
Each of these algorithms was trained using projective and non-projective methods, yielding six
training settings per language.
The different
training algorithms have various meta-parameters,
which we optimized on the validation set for
each language/training-setting combination. The
3

Our algorithms also support labeled parsing (see Section
3.4). Initial experiments with labeled models showed the same
trend that we report here for unlabeled parsing, so for simplicity
we conducted extensive experiments only for unlabeled parsing.
4
The transformations were performed by running the projective parser with score +1 on correct dependencies and -1 otherwise: the resulting trees are guaranteed to be projective and to
have a minimum loss with respect to the correct tree. Note that
only the training sets were transformed.
5
It should be noted that McDonald et al. (2006) use a richer
feature set that is incomparable to our features.

averaged perceptron has a single meta-parameter,
namely the number of iterations over the training set.
The log-linear models have two meta-parameters:
the regularization constant C and the number of
gradient steps T taken by the conjugate-gradient
optimizer. The EG approach also has two metaparameters: the regularization constant C and the
number of iterations, T .6 For models trained using
non-projective algorithms, both projective and nonprojective parsing was tested on the validation set,
and the highest scoring of these two approaches was
then used to decode test data sentences.
Table 2 reports test results for the six training scenarios. These results show that for Dutch, which is
the language in our data that has the highest number of crossing dependencies, non-projective training gives signiﬁcant gains over projective training
for all three training methods. For the other languages, non-projective training gives similar or even
improved performance over projective training.
Table 3 gives an additional set of results, which
were calculated as follows. For each of the three
training methods, we used the validation set results
to choose between projective and non-projective
training. This allows us to make a direct comparison of the three training algorithms. Table 3
6
We trained the perceptron for 100 iterations, and chose the
iteration which led to the best score on the validation set. Note
that in all of our experiments, the best perceptron results were
actually obtained with 30 or fewer iterations. For the log-linear
and EG algorithms we tested a number of values for C, and for
each value of C ran 100 gradient steps or EG iterations, ﬁnally
choosing the best combination of C and T found in validation.

shows the results of this comparison.7 The results
show that log-linear and max-margin models both
give a higher average accuracy than the perceptron.
For some languages (e.g., Japanese), the differences
from the perceptron are small; however for other
languages (e.g., Arabic, Dutch or Slovene) the improvements seen are quite substantial.

Conclusions

This paper describes inference algorithms for
spanning-tree distributions, focusing on the fundamental problems of computing partition functions
and marginals. Although we concentrate on loglinear and max-margin estimation, the inference algorithms we present can serve as black-boxes in
many other statistical modeling techniques.
Our experiments suggest that marginal-based
training produces more accurate models than perceptron learning. Notably, this is the ﬁrst large-scale
application of the EG algorithm, and shows that it is
a promising approach for structured learning.
In line with McDonald et al. (2005b), we conﬁrm
that spanning-tree models are well-suited to dependency parsing, especially for highly non-projective
languages such as Dutch. Moreover, spanning-tree
models should be useful for a variety of other problems involving structured data.

We ran the sign test at the sentence level to measure the
statistical signiﬁcance of the results aggregated across the six
languages. Out of 2,472 sentences total, log-linear models gave
improved parses over the perceptron on 448 sentences, and
worse parses on 343 sentences. The max-margin method gave
improved/worse parses for 500/383 sentences. Both results are
signiﬁcant with p ≤ 0.001.
