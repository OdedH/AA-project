has been increased interest in applying the beneﬁts of Bayesian inference and nonparametric models to these
problems.

In this example, four mixtures of Gaussians were generated and EM was used to learn a clustering. The example
shows the fundamental problem of using maximum likelihood as a criterion for selecting the complexity of a
model. As the complexity (number of clusters) increases, the training likelihood strictly improves. However, the
test likelihood improves initially but then degrades after a certain point.

...

• Cross-validation: select a model based on

• Bayesian model selection: use marginal likelihood or
minimum description length
Discrete optimization: combinatorial search over
models
4

The traditional approach to select the model of the right complexity is to search through a discrete space of
models, using a complexity penalty as a criteria for guiding the search. This might be diﬃcult if we need to
integrate out model parameters (e.g., in computing marginal likelihood).

A nonparametric Bayesian approach
Deﬁne one model with an inﬁnite number of clusters but
penalize the use of more clusters.
Θ

This penalty is accomplished with the Dirichlet process.
Continuous optimization: model complexity governed by
magnitude of parameters
Advantages:
• Works on structured models
• Allows EM-like tools
5

The nonparametric Bayesian approach does not choose between diﬀerent models but instead deﬁnes one model,
thus blurring the distinction between model and parameters. The advantage of this approach is that we will be
able to use familiar tools similar to the EM algorithm for parameter estimation.

True or false?
1. Being Bayesian is just about having priors.
Being Bayesian is about managing uncertainty.
2. Bayesian methods are slow.
Bayesian methods can be just as fast as EM.
3. Nonparametric means no parameters.
Nonparametric means the number of
eﬀective parameters grows adaptively with
the data.
4. Variational inference is complicated and foreign.
Variational inference is a natural extension of EM.
6

There are many myths about Bayesian methods being slow and diﬃcult to use. We will show that with suitable
approximations, we can get the beneﬁts of being Bayesian without paying an enormous cost.

Part I / Distributions and Bayesian principles

10

The traditional frequentist approach is to estimate a single best parameter θ ∗ given the data x, using, for
example, maximum likelihood. However, in reality, the data is noisy so actually we are uncertain about our
parameter estimate θ ∗. Therefore, we should maybe return several θs in order to reﬂect our uncertainty about
the best θ. This is a bottom-up motivation for the Bayesian approach.

Multinomial distribution
Most parameters in NLP are distributions p(z) over discrete objects
z ∈ {1, . . . , K}.
Possible p(z)s are the points φs on the simplex. For K = 3:

If we draw some number of independent samples from
Multinomial(φ), the probability of observing cz counts of observation
z is proportional to:
φ1c1 · · · φK cK
Part I / Distributions and Bayesian principles

11

A multinomial distribution is a distribution over K possible outcomes {1, . . . , K}. A parameter setting for a
K
multinomial distribution is a point on the simplex: φ = (φ1, . . . , φK ), φz ≥ 0, z=1 φz = 1. We have turned
multinomial distributions into ﬁrst-class objects, so we can refer to φ instead of p(z). The form of the probability
of drawing (c1, . . . , cK ) will play an important role in Dirichlet-multinomial conjugacy.

Distributions over multinomial parameters
A Dirichlet distribution is a distribution over multinomial
parameters φ in the simplex.
Like a Gaussian, there’s a notion of mean and variance.

All distributions we encounter in practice have a mean and variance. For a Gaussian N (µ, σ 2), they are explicitly
represented in the parameters. For the Dirichlet distribution, the mapping between parameters and moments is
not as simple.

Dirichlet distribution
A Dirichlet is speciﬁed by concentration parameters:
α = (α1, . . . , αK ), αz ≥ 0
Mean:

α
α
P 1 ,..., P n
z αz
z αz

Variance: larger αs → smaller variance
A Dirichlet draw φ is written φ ∼ Dirichlet(α),
which means p(φ | α) ∝ φ1α1−1 · · · φK αK −1
The Dirichlet distribution assigns probability mass to multinomials
that are likely to yield pseudocounts (α1 − 1, . . . , αK − 1).
Mode:

P α1 −1 , . . . , P αn −1
z (αz −1)
z (αz −1)

The full expression for the density of a Dirichlet is p(φ | α) = QK z=1 z
z=1 φz . Note that unlike
z=1 Γ(αz )
the Gaussian, the mean and mode of the Dirichlet are distinct. This leads to a small discrepancy between
concentration parameters and pseudocounts: concentration parameters α correspond to pseudocounts α − 1.

A Dirichlet(1, 1, 1) is a uniform distribution over multinomial parameters. As the concentration parameters
increase, the uncertainty over parameters decreases. Going in the other direction, concentration parameters
near zero encourage sparsity, placing probability mass in the corners of the simplex. This sparsity property is
the key to the Dirichlet process.

The Bayesian paradigm gives us a way to derive the optimal distribution over the parameters q(θ) given data.
We start with a prior p(θ), multiply the likelihood of the data we observe p(x | θ), and renormalize to get the
posterior p(θ | x). The computation of this posterior is generally the main focus of Bayesian inference.

The simplest example of computing the posterior is when there are no hidden variables. Assume we have 3
outcomes (A, B, C). Notation: the subscript 3 on the Dirichlet means that the dimensionality is 3 and the
superscript on the multinomial means that x is a sequence of 7 observations. Since the Dirichlet and multinomial
distributions are conjugate, the posterior can be computed in closed form and has the same form as the prior.

For the Dirichlet example, we could compute the posterior analytically. This is not always the case, in particular,
when there are hidden variables. In the two-component mixture model example, the posterior is shown with
the hidden variables z marginalized out. Convention: letters denote outcomes of the data and numbers denote
components.

Using the posterior for prediction
Setup:
Assume a joint probabilistic model p(θ)p(x, y | θ)
over input x, output y, parameters θ.
Training examples: (x1, y1), . . . , (xn, yn)
Test input: xnew
Traditional: ynew∗ = argmaxynew p(ynew | xnew, θ)
Bayes-optimal prediction:
ynew∗ = argmaxynew p(ynew | xnew, {(xi, yi)})
Explicitly write out the integrated parameters:
p(ynew | xnew, {(xi, yi)}) =

p(ynew | xnew, θ) p(θ | {(xi, yi)}) dθ
posterior

We can plug in an approximate posterior:
p(ynew | xnew, {(xi, yi)}) =

p(ynew | xnew, θ)qapprox(θ)dθ

Part I / Distributions and Bayesian principles

18

We have mentioned the desire to compute the posterior over parameters p(θ | x). Now we motivate this
computation with a prediction task. Note that this decision-theoretic framework supports arbitrary loss functions,
but we have specialized to the 0-1 loss (which corresponds to maximizing probability) to ease notation.

Variational Bayesian inference
Goal of Bayesian inference: compute posterior p(θ, z | x)
Variational inference is a framework for approximating the:
true posterior with the best from a set of distributions Q:
q ∗ = argminq∈Q KL(q(θ, z)||p(θ, z | x))
Q
q ∗(θ, z)

p(θ, z | x)

Part I / Variational Bayesian inference

20

The variational inference framework gives a principled way of ﬁnding an approximate distribution which is as
close (as measured by KL) to the posterior. This will allow us to tackle posterior computations for models such
as mixtures.

Types of variational approximations
q ∗ = argmin KL(q(θ, z)||p(θ, z | x))

What types of Q can we consider?

Part I / Variational Bayesian inference

21

The quality of the approximation depends on Q: the bigger the Q, the better. Two of the familiar classical
algorithms (hard EM and EM) are based on a particular kind of Q. We will show that mean-ﬁeld is a natural
extension, by expanding Q but staying within the same framework. Of course, there are even larger Qs, but we
risk losing tractability in those cases.

Heuristic derivation of mean-ﬁeld
Algorithm template: iterate between the E-step and M-step.
Let us ﬁrst heuristically derive the mean-ﬁeld algorithm.
E-step
M-step
Find best z
Find best θ
z∗ = argmaxz p(z | θ ∗, x)
θ ∗ = argmaxθ p(θ | z∗, x)
Find best distrib. over z
q(z)∗ ∝ p(z | θ, x)

Take distrib. into account
θ ∗ = argmaxθ z q(z)p(θ | z, x)
θ ∗ = argmaxθ z p(θ | z, x)q(z)

Take distrib. into account
q(z)∗ ∝ θ p(z | θ, x)q(θ )

Find best distrib. over θ
q(θ)∗ ∝ z p(θ | z, x)q(z)

Inﬁnite product over θ has closed form if q(θ) is a Dirichlet.

Part I / Variational Bayesian inference

22

Before we formally derive algorithms based on the variational framework, let us heuristically consider what the
update for mean-ﬁeld might look like. Note that when we taking the approximating distribution into account,
we use a “geometric” expectation rather than a simple average. This follows from using KL-divergence and
makes computation tractable. The new challenge introduced by the mean-ﬁeld E-step is the inﬁnite product,
but this can be handled by exploiting certain properties of q.

Formal derivation of mean-ﬁeld
q ∗ = argmin KL(q(θ, z)||p(θ, z | x))
q∈Q

Steps:
1. Formulate as an optimization problem (variational
principle)
2. Relax the optimization problem (e.g., mean-ﬁeld)
3. Solve using coordinate-wise descent

Part I / Variational Bayesian inference

23

Now that we know what the ﬁnal algorithm will look like, let us derive the algorithms directly as consequences
of the KL objective.

Kullback-Leibler divergence
KL measures how diﬀerent two distributions p and q are.
Deﬁnition:
def

q(θ)
KL(q||p) = Eq log p(θ)

An important property:
KL(q||p) ≥ 0
KL(q||p) = 0 if and only if q = p
KL is asymmetric:
Assuming KL(q||p) < ∞,
p(θ) = 0 ⇒ q(θ) = 0 [q“ ⊂ ”p]

Part I / Variational Bayesian inference

24

The optimization problem is in terms of KL-divergence. Before solving the optimization problem, we review
some of the properties of KL.

Minimizing with respect to KL
Since KL = 0 exactly when two arguments are equal, we have:
p = argminq∈Qall KL(q||p) and p = argminq∈Qall KL(p||q)
where Qall is all possible distributions.

In ﬁtting a model, the approximating distribution is often the second argument (with the ﬁrst being the empirical
distribution). These distributions are over observed data, where one wants to assign mass to more than just
the observed data. For variational inference, the distributions are over parameters, and the approximating
distribution appears in the ﬁrst argument. This yields a tractable optimization problem. Also, it allows us
to consider degenerate q with non-degenerate p (as in EM). The symmetric modes of a mixture model are
redundant, so it makes sense to capture only one of them anyway.

Step 1: formulate as optimization problem
Variational principle: write the quantity we wish to compute
as the solution of an optimization problem:
def

q ∗ = argmin KL(q(θ) || p(θ | x)),
q∈Qall

where Qall is set of all distributions over parameters.
Solution: q ∗(θ) = p(θ | x), which achieves KL = 0.
This is not very useful yet because q ∗ is just as hard to
compute...
Normalization of p not needed:
argminq KL(q(θ)||p(θ | x)) = argminq KL(q(θ)||p(θ, x))
Part I / Variational Bayesian inference

26

The variational principle is a general technique which originated out of physics, and can be applied to many
other problems besides inference in graphical models. See [Wainwright, Jordan, 2003] for a thorough treatment
of variational methods for graphical models. Note that the full posterior is p(θ, z | x), but we integrate out z
here so that we can visualize the posterior over parameters p(θ | x) = z p(θ, z | x) on the next slide.

The advantage of using optimization is that it leads naturally to approximations: either by changing the domain
(which we do) or the objective function (which would lead to algorithms like belief propagation). Here, we show
the optimal approximating distributions for various Qs on the simple two-component mixture example.

Step 3: coordinate-wise descent
Goal: minimize KL(q(θ)||p(θ | x)) subject to q ∈ Q
Assume: q(θ) =

i qi (θi )

Algorithm: for each i, optimize qi(θi) holding all other
coordinates q−i(θ−i) ﬁxed.

28

Mean-ﬁeld only speciﬁes the optimization problem based on the variational framework. We could use any
number of generic optimization algorithms to solve the mean-ﬁeld objective. However, a particularly simple and
intuitive method is to use coordinate-wise descent. To simplify notation, let θ both the parameters and the
hidden variables.

Mean-ﬁeld recipe
qi(θi) ∝ exp{Eq−i log p(θi | θ−i, x)}
∝ exp{Eq−i log p(θ, x)}
Recipe for updating qi:
1. Write down all the unobserved variables in the model
(including parameters and latent variables)
2. For each variable θi:
a. Write down only the factors of the joint distribution
that contain θi
b. Set qi ∝ exp{Eq−i log(those factors)}

Part I / Variational Bayesian inference

29

We give a generic recipe for deriving a mean-ﬁeld algorithm for any probabilistic model. The remaining work
is to actually compute the exp E log, which is not obviously doable at all. It turns out that it works out
when we have conjugate and our distributions are in the exponential family. Later we show this is true for the
Dirichlet-multinomial pair.

Often the term variational is associated with another setting, where we wish to do inference in a loopy graph,
either as part of an E-step for a directed model with hidden variables or a gradient computation for an undirected
model. These cases can be interpreted as instances of the variational framework.

There are several ways to represent a probabilistic model. The graphical model allows one to visualize the
dependencies between all the random variables in the model, which corresponds to a particular factoring of
the joint probability distribution, where each factor is for example, p(zi | β). The procedural notation actually
speciﬁes the form of the distributions via a sequence of draws (e.g., zi ∼ Multinomial(β)). Note that we are
representing the data model abstractly as (G0, F ).

We can derive hard EM for the Bayesian ﬁnite model using the recipe given at the end of Part I. Since

all qs are degenerate, optimizing the distribution is the same as optimizing a point. For example, zi =
argmaxz exp Eq−zi log p(z | β)p(xi | φz ). Since q is degenerate, the exp and log cancel, leaving us with the
classical hard E-step.

Now we show the mean-ﬁeld algorithm. The M-step for the mean-ﬁeld algorithm involves just updating the
Dirichlet distribution. Rather than normalizing, the M-step keeps the full counts obtained during the E-step.
This extra degree of freedom gives mean-ﬁeld the ability to deal with uncertainty. For simplicity, we only
consider the update for the component probabilities β, not the component parameters φ.

The E-step requires a bit more work, as it involves the inﬁnite product over θ, or equivalently computing
exp E log. Because the approximation is fully-factorized the optimal update breaks down into independent
integrals, each over a separate parameter. We call these quantities multinomial weights.

The multinomial weights are like sub-probabilities (they always sum to less than 1 by Jensen’s inequality). The
more uncertainty there is, the smaller the weights. The computation of the multinomial weights bridges the
M-step and the E-step: they are computed based on the posterior distributions computed in the M-step and
used in the E-step. The digamma function Ψ(·) = ∂Γ(x) is an easy function whose code can be copied out of

We now embark on the development of the DP. Earlier, we said that the DP prior penalizes extra clusters. It
turns out that this penalty is based on uncertainty in parameter estimates. The more clusters there are, the
more fragmented the counts are, leading to greater uncertainty. We start by giving concrete intuition about
how just the mean-ﬁeld algorithm on ﬁnite mixtures can achieve this. The exp(Ψ(·)) plot captures the essence
of the DP from the point of view of mean-ﬁeld for multinomial data.

By ignoring the data-dependent factor W (xi | zi), we can focus on the tendencies of the mean-ﬁeld algorithm.
As the diagram shows, W (zi) encourages very few clusters. On the other hand, W (xi | zi) takes into account
the data, for which we might need many clusters to explain the data. A balance is obtained by combining both
factors.

43

Now we focus on the data-dependent factor W (xi | zi). The example shows that even in the absence of W (zi),
there is a tendency to prefer few larger clusters over many small ones. To guard against this type of overﬁtting,
add- smoothing is often used. However, note that add- smoothing in this case will only mitigate the diﬀerence
but will never strictly prefer component 1 over 2.

This example shows a concrete case where being sensitive to uncertainty in parameters better using mean-ﬁeld
can improve performance with a very localized change to the original EM code. [Moore, 2004] also took note
of this problem with rare words and used add- smoothing.

The issue is that the Dirichlet is symmetric.
We need an asymmetric approach, where the large
components are ﬁrst on average.
Part II / DP mixture model

47

A ﬁrst attempt at deﬁning an inﬁnite mixture model is to take the limit of ﬁnite mixture models. This
doesn’t work because Dirichlet distributions are symmetric, but the limiting index set {1, 2, . . . } is intrinsically
asymmetric.

Size-biased permutation
Solution: take a size-biased permutation of the components:
• Generate β ∼ Dirichlet( α0 , . . . , α0 ):

A way to get an asymmetric set of component probabilities is to generate from a symmetric Dirichlet and
permute the probabilities. The size-biased permutation will tend to put the large ones ﬁrst on average. Note:

49

Size-biased permutation motivates the asymmetric GEM distribution, but it can be deﬁned directly. The
stick-breaking probabilities decrease exponentially in expectation, but of course sometimes a large stick can
follow a small one. It can be shown that the stick-breaking probabilities sum to 1 with probability 1.

Part II / DP mixture model

51

There is another complication, which is that the densities between the two parameterizations are related through
a non-identity Jacobian: p(β) = p(v) · Jacobian. Therefore, argmaxv p(v) does not necessarily correspond to
argmaxβ p(β). The most likely point depends on which parameterization you pick. Full Bayesian inference
integrates out these parameters, so parameterization is not an issue.

52

Finally, we formally deﬁne the DP mixture model. In practice, there is not a noticeable diﬀerence between using
a ﬁnite Dirichlet prior with small concentration parameters and using a truncated stick-breaking prior. After
all, both converge to the DP. A more empirically important knob is the choice of inference algorithm. It is
important to note that using a stick-breaking truncation of K is not the same as just using a K-component
mixture model with concentration parameters that do not scale with 1/K. In the former, as K increases, the
approximation to the same DP becomes strictly better, whereas in the latter, the models become more complex.

We have focused on the deﬁnition of the Dirichlet process via the stick-breaking deﬁnition. Later, we will
continue to use it to deﬁne structured models. But for completeness, we present some other deﬁnitions of the

We present one deﬁnition of the Dirichlet process based on the stick-breaking construction, building from
the DP mixture model. The Dirichlet process is a distribution on distributions G, where G is constructed
by combining stick-breaking probabilities and i.i.d. draws from G0. This allows us to encapsulate both the
component probabilities and parameters into one object G. It turns out this prior over G can be deﬁned in
other ways as we shall see.

The stochastic process deﬁnition is an alternative way to deﬁne G. Unlike the stick-breaking construction, the
stochastic process deﬁnition is more declarative, expressing the distribution of G in terms of the distribution
of parts of G. This is typically the way a stochastic process is deﬁned. Note that when Ω is a ﬁnite set, the
Dirichlet process is equivalent to an ordinary Dirichlet distribution. Viewed in this light, the Dirichlet process is

What is the distribution of ψi | ψ1, . . . , ψi−1 marginalizing out G?
Metaphor: customer = data point, dish = parameter,
table = cluster
A Chinese restaurant has an inﬁnite number of tables.
Customer i:
• joins the table of a previous customer j and shares the dish, or
• starts a new table and randomly picks a new dish from G0

The Chinese restaurant process (CRP) is yet a third way to view the Dirichlet process. This time, we are not
interested in G itself, but rather draws from G with G integrated out. Formally, the CRP is a distribution
over partitions (clusterings) of the data points. The P´lya urn refers to distribution over dishes. An important
o
property about the CRP is that despite its sequential deﬁnition, the dishes (and tables) are actually exchangeable,
meaning p(ψ1, . . . , ψn) = p(ψπ(1), . . . , ψπ(n)) for any permutation π. This can be directly seen as a consequence
of de Finetti’s theorem.

We will use the DP mixture model as a building block in creating more complex models. First, we develop the
HDP mixture model, which allows many mixture models to share the same inventory of components. Based on
this, we then create structured models such as HDP-HMMs and HDP-PCFGs.

Part III / Structured models

61

The top-level probabilities β determine the overall popularity of components, to a ﬁrst-order approximation,
which components are active. Each πj is based on β, but is tailored for group j. An application is topic
modeling, where each group is a document, each component is a topic (distribution over words), and each data
point is a word. In this light, the HDP is an nonparametric extension of LDA. Note: the HDP mixture model
can also be deﬁned using the stochastic process deﬁnition or the Chinese restaurant franchise, the hierarchical
analogue of the CRP.

Part III / Structured models

62

We tie the πj s together using a Dirichlet process, which is best understood in terms of the stochastic process
deﬁnition, where the distributions involved are over the positive integers. Note: there is another deﬁnition of
the HDP where for each group j, we draw a separate set of stick-breaking probabilities from GEM(α ), which
then can be used to induce the corresponding distribution on π j . The disadvantage of this approach is that it
introduces extra variables and indirect pointers which complicates variational inference.

Sharing component probabilities
Draw top-level component probabilities β ∼ GEM(α):
α=2
Draw group-level component probabilities π ∼ DP(α , β):
α =1
α =5
α = 20
α = 100
As α increases, the more π resembles β.

Part III / Structured models

63

There are two concentration parameters, α and α . The parameter α controls how many components there are
overall and α controls how similar the prior distributions over components across groups.

• Let q(β) = δβ ∗ (β) for tractability, optimize with gradient descent
Part III / Structured models

64

The only added challenge in doing mean-ﬁeld inference in the HDP is how to optimize the top-level components.
Because the GEM prior is not conjugate with the DP draws from β, it’s convenient to let q(β) be degenerate
and optimize it using standard gradient methods.

• φz : emission parameters
Key:
β ∼ GEM(α) speciﬁes which states will be used (global)
π z ∼ DP(α , β) speciﬁes distribution over next states (per state)
Part III / Structured models

65

We can think of an HMM as a mixture model, where each component corresponds to a state of the HMM.
Given a state, we need to emit an observation and advance to the next state. The component parameters must
specify the distributions associated with these stochastic choices. The transition parameters must specify a
distribution over states, which is naturally represented with a draw from a DP. The HDP framework allows us
to tie all the transition DPs.

Mean-ﬁeld inference is similar to EM for classical HMMs. It is straightforward to check that the forwardbackward dynamic program for the E-step still remains tractable when using a non-degenerate q(φ). Here, K
is the truncation applied to β.

The nonparametric Bayesian machinery carries over from HMMs to PCFGs again by replacing normalization
with an application of exp(Ψ(·)). The addition of DPs centered on the cross-product of the top-level distribution
does complicate the optimization of β.

Prediction revisited
Train on x; now get test xnew, want to ﬁnd best znew.
p(znew | xnew) = Ep(θ|x)p(znew | xnew, θ)
Eq(θ)p(znew | xnew, θ)
Contrast with training (has log):
q(znew) ∝ exp Eq(θ) log p(znew | xnew, θ)
To ﬁnd argmaxznew Eq(θ)p(znew | xnew, θ), consider all znew:
intractable when znew is a parse tree because cannot use
dynamic programming (unlike training)
Approximations:
• Use mode of q(θ)
• Maximize expected log-likelihood as in training
• Reranking: get an n-best list using proxy; choose best one
Part III / Structured models

68

We have spent most of our time approximating posteriors. Now let’s see how we can use them for structured
prediction. When we have point estimates of parameters, the standard prediction rule is the same as running a
hard E-step during training. However, with non-degenerate parameters, the log during training decouples parts
of the structure, allowing dynamic programming. At test time, dynamic programming can no longer be used in
the absence of the log.

The top-down (Bayesian) approach: deﬁne a model (such as a DP mixture model) and then approximate
the posterior using an inference algorithm. The bottom-up approach: design an algorithm directly based on
properties of the data. Sometimes the two approaches coincide: for example, smoothing and discounting can
have interpretations as Bayesian priors. Many NLP methods are reasonable and eﬀective but lack a top-level
interpretation, which could provide additional insight.

Why doesn’t my variational DP work?
Modeling issues
• Setting concentration parameters is still an art.
• Is the DP even the right prior to use?
Inference issues
• Mean-ﬁeld is an approximation of the true posterior.
• The coordinate-wise descent algorithm for optimizing
the mean-ﬁeld objective is susceptible to local minima
problems, just as is EM.

Part III / Survey of related methods

71

We have focused on using Dirichlet processes with variational inference for clustering, sequence modeling, etc.
However, there are two places something could go wrong: having bad modeling assumptions or having a local
optima problem with inference.

Other inference methods
We focused on variational inference using the stick-breaking
construction.
Algorithm:
• Variational (mean-ﬁeld, expectation propagation, etc.):
deterministic, fast, converge to local optima
• Sampling (Gibbs, split-merge, etc.): converges to true
posterior (but don’t know when), could be stuck in
local optima for a long time
Representation:
• Stick-breaking construction: simple, concrete
• Chinese restaurant process: works well for simple
mixture models
Part III / Survey of related methods

72

If inference is a problem, one could consider other inference methods. There are two major axes along which
we could classify an inference algorithm: variational/sampling or CRP/stick-breaking, leading to four diﬀerent
algorithms. Each has its advantages, but the problem of posterior inference is fundamentally a challenging one.

The Bayesian elephant

Even just the elephant posterior is intractable.
Mean-ﬁeld guy: “feels like smoothing/discounting”
Sampling guy: “feels like stochastic hill-climbing”
A common property: rich gets richer

Part III / Survey of related methods

73

Viewing a model through one particular inference algorithm leads to a particular way of thinking about the
problem. It is important to remember that it is not the complete story. Of course, we are talking about
one model, so there are common properties (e.g., rich gets richer) which are shared by the diﬀerent inference
algorithms.

Other nonparametric priors
• Pitman-Yor process: component probabilities less
sparse compared to the DP; yields power-law
distributions useful for language modeling. [Pitman,
Yor, 1997; Teh, 2006]
• Beta process / Indian buﬀet process: allows data
points to belong to more than one cluster; inﬁnite
number of latent features, each data point generated
using a ﬁnite subset. [Griﬃths, Ghahramani, 2007;
Thibaux, Jordan, 2007]
• etc.
Many of these priors also have stochastic process, Chinese
restaurant, stick-breaking counterparts.
Part III / Survey of related methods

74

If inference is not the problem, perhaps the model is not suitable for the task at hand. For example, Pitman-Yor
priors give power law distributions more suitable for modeling the distribution of words than Dirichlet priors.

We’ve focused primarily on models built from mixtures, which are useful for inducing hidden structure in data.
We have extended classical mixture models along two axes: being more Bayesian and being more nonparametric.
Moving along these two axes is also applicable in other methods, e.g. classiﬁcation, regression, etc.

Marginal likelihood: The probability of the observed data,
marginalizing out unknown parameters. This quantity is lower
bounded in variational inference.
Markov Chain Monte Carlo: A randomized approximate inference
algorithm with nice asymptotic properties.
Mean-ﬁeld: A fully-factorized approximation for variational
inference.

Glossary
Nonparametric: Refers to models where the number of eﬀective
parameters can grow with the amount of data. The Dirichlet
process is an example of a nonparametric prior.
Posterior: The distribution over unknown quantities in a model
(parameters) conditioned on the observed data.
Prior: A distribution over unknown quantities in the model
(parameters) before observing data.
Stick-breaking representation: A constructive deﬁnition of the
Dirichlet process prior.
Variational Bayes: Variational inference for computing the
posterior in Bayesian models.
