Overview

Identiﬁability from moments
Deﬁnition (global identiﬁability): model family Θ ⊂ [0, 1]p is identiﬁable
from a moment function φ(x) if SΘ (θ0 ) = {θ ∈ Θ : Eθ [φ(x)] = Eθ0 [φ(x)]} is ﬁnite
for almost every θ0 ∈ Θ; that is: given moments Eθ [φ(x)], possible to recover
parameters θ up to a ﬁnite equivalence class (e.g., permutation of states)?

Model: Pθ (x, z) over parse trees z and sentences x
ˆ
Goal: given n sentences x(1) , . . . , x(n) , produce parameter estimate θ

Challenge: tree topology is unobserved and varies across sentences

Probabilistic Context-Free Grammars (PCFG)
For L = 3 words:

General identiﬁability checker:
˜
1. Choose a single θ ∈ Θ uniformly at random.
2. Compute Jacobian matrix J(θ) = ∂Eθ [φ(x)]
˜
∈ Rm×p .
˜
∂θ
θ=θ
˜
3. Return identiﬁable iﬀ J(θ) is full rank.
Theorem: identiﬁability checker is correct with probability 1.
Signiﬁcance:
Test random point (cheap, local information) ⇒ identifable? (global property)
Intuition: space is nice because moments are polynomials of parameters

Proposition (unmixing):
If ej in row space of M , can recover Ψj;η .
Call base algorithm on Ψj;η to recover θ.
All operations involve low-order matrix computations.
Sample complexity n is polynomial in k, d, L and spectral properties of T, O.

Two questions:
• Which model families Pθ (x, z) are identiﬁable?
Our result: PCFG is not identiﬁable.
• How to estimate parameters without local optima issues?
Our result: new unmixing technique works for restricted PCFGs.

Purpose: used to recover parameters when tree structure is known.
Unknowns (think of these as parameters):

M1 , M2 ∈ R
: matrices with full column rank
D ∈ Rk : diagonal matrix with distinct diagonal entries
Result: can recover M1 up to scaling/permutation of columns
