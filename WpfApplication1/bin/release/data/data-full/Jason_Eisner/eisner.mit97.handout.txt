of highly general constraints, which, through ranking, interact to produce the
elaborate particularity of individual languages.”
(Prince & Smolensky 1993,
p. 198)

(see also Smolensky 1995, Green 1994)

1. A much-asked question.

2. The search for core mechanisms

What constraints does OT allow? i.e., What is the substance of the theory?

Suppose we had a set Con of core constraints for phonology—simple mechanisms
that could be used to build up all the basic phonological phenomena. What would it
look like?

(1) Some clearly bad constraints (but what makes them bad?):
a. Palindromic: The candidate reads the same backwards as forwards.
b. FtQuint: Feet are quintary (5 syllables or moras).
c. MemberOf(a, aardvark, aardvarks, aardwolf, aardwolves, Aaron . . . ):
Candidate must be in the speciﬁed set of surface forms.
d. MatchesOutputOfSPE: The output matches the result of applying
Chomsky & Halle (1968) to the input.

Ask: What formal devices are regularly used by constraints in the literature?
(6) a. NasVoi

(Itˆ, Mester, & Padgett 1996)
o

“Every nasal segment must be linked to some voicing feature.”

b. Onset
Align(σ, L, C, L)

(equivalent)

(Prince & Smolensky 1993)
(McCarthy & Prince 1993)

“Every syllable must begin with (be left-aligned with) some consonant.”

(2) Some clearly okay constraints (but what makes them okay?):
a. Clash-ATR: Low vowels may not bear the atr feature.
b. Onset: Every syllable must start with a consonant.
(3) Some questionable constraints, by the standards of derivational phonology:
a. FtBin: Feet are binary (2 syllables or moras).
b. Align-L(Foot, PrWd): The sum of all distances from left edges of feet to
the left edge of the PrWd is minimized. (For consequences see (34).)
c. Half the constraints that ﬁrst-year phonology students make up.
Reasons to try to formalize OT, rather than allowing ad hoc English constraints:
(4) a. Results in an explicit, falsiﬁable theory of UG
b. Simpliﬁes that theory, exposing formal similarities among constraints
c. Enables computational work (e.g., Eisner 1997b)
(tools for linguists; algorithms for generation, parsing, acquisition; theorems on
expressive power)

d. Constrains linguistic description
e. Aids descriptive work by providing well-motivated and well-formalized
constraints and representations
(many constraints given informally in the literature, including GA, do not
specify how to count violations in all circumstances)

The formalization sketched in this talk is called OTP—OT with primitive
constraints.
(5) Identifying such core constraints is at the center of the OT program:
“The danger, therefore, lies in . . . clinging to a conception of Universal Grammar
as little more than a loose organizing framework for grammars. A much stronger
stance, in close accord with the thrust of recent work, is available . . . Universal
Grammar can supply the very substance from which grammars are built: a set

1

c. Common thread: “Every . . . some.”
∀α, ∃β such that α and β stand in such-and-such local relationship.
If we allow α and β to be edges (as one option), we only need one kind of local
relationship—temporal coocurrence:
(7) The primitive implication family.
α → β means: ∀α, ∃β such that α and β coincide temporally.
(8) Rewrite (6):
a. nas → voi: ∀nas, ∃voi such that nas and voi coincide temporally.
b. σ [ → C [ : ∀ σ [ , ∃ C [ such that σ [ and C [ coincide temporally.
Thus we can regard alignment as “edge licensing.” (Or licensing is “feature
alignment.”) We can also mix references to edges and interiors:
(9) F → ]µ : Every foot must cross a mora boundary. (No degenerate feet.)
(= Min-2m: Green & Kenstowicz 1995)
Like GA, primitive implication is formal rather than substantive:
Onset: σ [ → C [ , NoOnset: σ [ → V [ , Coda: ]σ → ]C , and NoCoda:
]σ → ]V are all equally easy to express using this family. So as in other theories,
UG must still state that Onset and NoCoda are strongly preferred by human
grammars. (The dispreferred constraints may still be possible: e.g., Hammond
1995 proposes a NoOnset constraint for stressless syllables. See Green 1994 on
metaconstraints.)
McCarthy & Prince (1993) have previously noted that alignment plays a unifying
role, and have suggested that it’s the core mechanism for all of phonology:
(10) a. “These examples only hint at the generality of the phenomenon to be explored
2

here, which extends to include all the various ways that constituents may be
enjoined to share an edge in prosody and morphology. Data like these have been
given widely disparate treatments in the literature . . . ” (p. 1)
b. “Taken together with X-like restrictions on immediate domination and interpreted within the appropriate theory of constraint satisfaction, GA provides a
mechanism for completely spec¡ifying a class of formal languages that, when substantive parameters are set, ought to be all-but-coextensive with possible human
languages.” (p. 2)

A second constraint family:
Above, we uniﬁed feature licensing and alignment.
The opposite of feature licensing is feature clash.
The opposite of alignment is disalignment, i.e., edge clash.
(11) a. *[low, atr]

(Cole & Kisseberth 1994)

“Low features are incompatible with atr features.”

b. Nonfinality = *Align(PrWd , R, F , R)

(e.g., Buckley 1995)

“Prosodic words may not be right-aligned with feet.”

(12) The primitive clash family.
α ⊥ β means: ∀α, ∃β such that α and β coincide temporally.

[cf. (7)]

Equivalently: ∀α ∀β, α and β are temporally disjoint.
(13) Rewrite (11):
a. low ⊥ atr: All low and atr features are temporally disjoint.
b. ]PrWd ⊥ ]F : Each ]PrWd does not coincide with (fall on) any ]F .
Again, this formulation suggests we can mix edges and interiors, and we can:
(14) F ⊥

M[ :

A foot may not cross a morpheme boundary.
(= Tauto-F, Crowhurst 1994)

(In fact, (14) is more plausible than Crowhurst’s formulation, * F [ σ M [ σ ]F .
It would be surprising to ﬁnd a language that crucially blocked M [ only where
Crowhurst states, while still allowing it to interrupt a syllable or a ternary foot.)

Null hypothesis: These two families of local primitive constraints —implication and
clash—are the only ones needed.
α → β says that α’s attract β’s.
α ⊥ β says that α’s repel β’s.
3. What representations are being constrained?
The primitive constraints are easiest to interpret if we assume that Òk is represented
as in (15b), not (15a). This representation is inspired by Optimal Domains Theory
(Cole & Kisseberth 1994) and Correspondence Theory (McCarthy & Prince 1995).

−→−→timeline−→−→

vel [

(The timeline is really just an ordered set of edge
brackets. Thus, only horizontal order matters in the
drawing above. Ignore spacing and vertical order.)
(16) Key characteristics of the new representation:
a. Constituents ﬂoat along a timeline.
Example constituents: nas (autosegmental), µ (prosodic), x (stress
mark), Stem (morphological), H-domain (feature domain)
b. The timeline is continuous, not divided into segments.
c. All constituents have width and edges. Thus we can refer naturally to the
edges of syllables (or morphemes) whose segmental features are scattered
across multiple tiers and perhaps shared with other syllables (cf. Itˆ &
o
Mester 1994).
d. For autosegments with width, such as [nas], think of phonetic gestures.
(15b), which begins with simultaneous nas [ (= lower the velum) and voi [
(= begin vibration of the vocal folds). The primitive constraints can only
aﬀect the order of bracket edges; it is up to the phonetic component to
determine actual durations.
e. Association or Correspondence of two constituents is indicated by having
them overlap. (Independently proposed by Bird & Klein 1990.) E.g., the
velar gesture in candidate (15b) spans both consonants.
f. No need for faithfulness constraints on the insertion, deletion, or relocation
of association lines (cf. Kirchner 1993, Myers 1994, F´ry 1994).
e
g. No need for (inviolable) well-formedness constraints against gapping or
crossing of associations (cf. Kirchner 1993, F´ry 1994, Oostendorp 1995).
e
h. No need for Correspondence indices.
(17) The behavior of Gen:
a. Hypothesis: Gen can’t do anything fancy, like palindromes—nothing that
the primitive constraints couldn’t also handle. So for convenience, let’s
make Gen as simple as possible, and let undominated constraints clean up
the huge unbridled candidate set that results.
b. Gen places constituents freely along the continuous timeline.
That is, as far as Gen is concerned, brackets may land anywhere.
Conditions such as the prosodic hierarchy are enforced by undominated
primitive constraints, not by Gen.
c. However, Gen requires that edge brackets come in matched pairs.
d. Gen also does not allow distinct constituents of the same type (e.g., two
syllables or two lab autosegments) to overlap. (Elements on the same tier
never link to each other.)
e. Gen is free only with regard to output material. It is forced to place a copy

4

of the input material into every candidate, on its own tier, for purposes of
I-O Correspondence. (Cf. Containment (Prince & Smolensky 1993), Strict
Consistency Constraint (Polgardi 1995).)
(18) Because the timeline is continuous
can fall in mid-segment:
a. Contour tones:
]H
H[
]L
L[
]V
V[

rather than divided into segments, brackets

(21) a. phonologically conditioned allomorphy: candidates try diﬀerent allomorphs
on the input timeline, and the constraints decide what works best.
b. ﬂoating tones and features: the lexicon speciﬁes only that H falls somewhere on the input. Diﬀerent candidates try diﬀerent locations for it in the
input. The output may or may not correspond.

H

L.

b. Geminates (long vowels are similar):

]σ

In general, the lexicon and morphology might not completely specify the input tiers.
In this case, candidates may diﬀer even on their input tiers—so long as all candidates
are consistent with what the lexicon and morphology do specify.

σ
σ
/|\ /|
C V C V

4. Input and output

c. ﬂoating morphemes, templatic morphology: morphology speciﬁes the order
of underlying segments within each morpheme, but lets the morphemes
overlap so that their segments intermix freely on the input tiers. These
segments may not be preserved in the output.
d. epenthesis (CC ⇒ CV C): The lexicon does not specify whether
input segments are adjacent, so they may be pushed apart.
V

I-O Correspondence (between input and output features): Signaled by alignment
between input and output tiers.

The crushing of V , when there is no surface V , allows the C’s to be
adjacent. This is encouraged by ]Segment → Segment [ and expected by
assimilation constraints.
(Only on the input tier may constituents have zero width.)

Like (a), this spread version satisﬁes Parse & Fill,
which only require overlap. Spreading may be required
to satisfy some other constraint. On the other hand,
various constraints can be invoked against spreading:
either voi ⊥ ]voi or ]voi → ]voi or ]voi → ]voi could
be used to block (d). (Cf. Yip, 1994:21,fn. 11, on
MSeg vs. *Insert Structure)

In short, the lexicon and morphology provide an underspeciﬁed timeline—an
ordering over a set of input edge brackets. In general this is only a partial ordering. The candidate set consists of all possible fully speciﬁed versions of this input
material, annotated in all possible ways with output constituents.
5. Formal deﬁnition of the constraints

(22) Formal statement of the primitive constraint families:
Thus, the timeline mechanism uniﬁes Correspondence relations with autosegmental
associations. Both are encoded by overlap on the constituent timeline. This ﬂeshes
out a proposal of McCarthy & Prince (1995):
(20) “The re-casting of autosegmental association in terms of correspondence relations
may be expected to have consequences for the analysis of tonal, harmonic, and
related phenomena. We do not explore these ideas here, though they are clearly
worth developing.” (p. 22)

5

a. α → β: Each α temporally overlaps some β.
Scoring: Each α without a β incurs one violation mark.
b. α ⊥ β: Each α temporally overlaps no β.
Scoring: Each overlap incurs one violation mark.
(23) What can α and β be?
a. Edges such as low [ or ]low .
b. Interiors such as low.

6

Denote only the interior of a constituent, without its edges.
Thus, low and atr do not overlap here:
]AT R
AT R [
]low
low [
I.e., the above candidate satisﬁes low ⊥ atr but violates low → atr.
c. Conjunctions and disjunctions as in (24).
(Dispreferred in analyses, on grounds of their greater complexity—they
refer to more features.)
(24) Occasionally, must allow the following generalized forms of (22). I propose to
limit conjunction/disjunction to these conﬁgurations only.
a. ( α1 and α2 and . . . ) → ( β1 or β2 or . . . )
Scoring: Violated once by each set of objects {A1 , A2 , . . .} of types
α1 , α2 , . . . respectively that all overlap on the timeline and whose
intersection does not overlap any object of type β1 , β2 , . . ..
b. ( α1 and α2 and . . . ) ⊥ ( β1 and β2 and . . . )
Scoring: Violated once by each set of objects {A1 , A2 , . . . , B1 , B2 , . . .}
of types α1 , α2 , . . . , β1 , β2 , . . . respectively that all overlap on the
timeline.
(Could also be notated: α1 ⊥ α2 ⊥ · · · ⊥ β1 ⊥ β2 ⊥ · · ·.)

Each violation mark is still triggered individually by a bad local condition in
the candidate, e.g., a moment on the timeline when certain edges are present
and others are not.
Note that some constraints require crisp alignment of edges ( x [ → y [ ), while others
are weaker and require only overlap (x → y), allowing spreading. (Cf. the violable
CrispEdge constraint of Itˆ & Mester (1994).)

6. Some further example constraints from the literature
This section illustrates how all the types of primitive constraints are ubiquitous
across diﬀerent areas of phonology.
My apologies in advance for any errors or mischaracterizations in these lists. Some of
these translations to OTP are not exact, but appear to act correctly on the data
in the papers cited. Also, note that sometimes there is more than one way to
paraphrase a constraint.

7. How about measuring distance?
Two important diﬀerences between F [ → PrWd [ and Align(F , L, PrWd , L):
• The → family doesn’t measure distance.
E.g., (´ σ)(´ σ)(´ σ)σ violates F [ → PrWd [ twice, once for each non-initial foot.
σ σ σ
• The → family isn’t only used for edges.
Interestingly, Zoll (1996:137–38) has independently argued that licensing has just
those properties (leading to her constraint Coincide(x,y)):
“There are two properties of licensing which distinguish it from the cases of aﬃxation
discussed [in M&P (1993)].
“First, licensing of marked structure never involves an injunction to be as close to a
strong position as possible. Rather, licensing always constitutes an all-or-nothing
proposition whereby marked structures are licit in licensed positions but ill-formed
everywhere else.”
“The second important diﬀerence is that licensing does not strictly involve coincidence

15

of edges or distance from an edge, but is concerned rather with membership in a
constituent which may be peripheral ... [e.g.] heavy syllables belong to the ﬁrst foot.”

Q: Is this local version of alignment powerful enough?
A: Perhaps so. For cases where it’s really necessary to measure distance, for example
to control the width of a feature domain:
(33) a. σ → XDom: X-domain should be as wide as possible (contain many σ’s).
b. σ ⊥ XDom: X-domain should be as narrow as possible (contain few σ’s).
Note that this trick, unlike GA, automatically speciﬁes the units of measurement. It
also avoids other deﬁnitional problems with GA.
Q: Is Generalized Alignment too powerful?
A: Probably. It’s a family of non-local constraints that do addition. That lets us
express very non-local, unattested phenomena.
Example of unwarranted power: The GA constraint in (34) wants the ﬂoating tone
to anchor as close to the center of the word as possible (subject to higher-ranked
constraints).
(34) Notes:
1. ´ denotes tone, not stress.
2. The nth column records the degree of misalignment of the nth syllable, at least
if GA measures this in syllables rather than segments (or moras: see Mester &
Padgett (1993)).
3. Assume that high-ranked faithfulness constraints rule out other candidates.
For example, as there is only one ﬂoating tone underlyingly, σ σ σ σ σ σ σ is ruled
´´´´´´´
out by Dep(H).

candidate’s total viols
violations contributed by 2nd syllable’s misalignment

If there were two ﬂoating tones, they’d want to anchor at 1/4 and 3/4 of the way
through the word.
This kind of non-local behavior via GA is unattested to my knowledge. It is also
beyond the power of known computational OT methods, in particular the ﬁnite-state
method of Ellison (1995) and the context-free method of Tesar (1996). The primitive
constraints are provably incapable of producing such behavior.
8. How to handle non-local phenomena?
Since OTP uses only the primitive constraints of §5, it claims that all phonology is
16

local.
Some apparently non-local phenomena can be reanalyzed:
• Metrical stress. Most non-local constraints in the literature concern metrical
stress, which has received both local and non-local analyses in the past.
– Local: Non-OT, iterative accounts (e.g., Prince 1983, Halle & Vergnaud
1987, Kager 1993, Hayes 1985, 1995).
– Non-local: McCarthy & Prince (1993) propose using Generalized Alignment constraints to measure the distance from each foot to the edge of
the word.
– Local: Less powerful alternatives to GA are possible. Could use directional “greedy” versions of primitive constraints like Parse(σ) or
Fill(Root), in which early violations count as decisively worse than later
ones. (Cf. Kager (1994), who argues for a greedy Align evaluated “foot
by foot.”)
– Local: Eisner (1997a) gives an OTP typology of metrical stress.
This paper uses a small set of primitive constraints, which are freely
reranked to get attested systems. This gives a uniﬁed ﬁne-grained
account of the following phenomena described by Hayes (1995).

a. As for all relations, OTP can enforce Correspondence only locally, so
Correspondent elements must always overlap on the timeline,
b. Thus, I-B faithfulness requires I and B to occupy the same portion of the
timeline. (on separate input and output tiers)
c. B-R faithfulness apparently requires R and B to occupy the same portion
of the timeline. But this would rule out B-R juncture eﬀects. which require
B to precede R or vice-versa. (e.g., enforcement of *VhV in Javanese)
d. So instead require R (on the output tier) and a copy of B (on its own
special tier) to occupy the same portion of the timeline.
e. Gen produces only candidates in which this copy of B is perfect. Thus, Gen
must know how to do reduplication of morphemes, not just aﬃxation.
f. Now all the non-locality is handled within Gen; the violable constraints
remain local.
(35) Some candidates produced by Gen on RED(b dah)-e. In Javanese, ﬁrst
candidate wins.

c.

The asymmetries above are reduced to (i) the universal onset-coda
asymmetry and (ii) the universal tendency of extrametricality to be ﬁnal.
• Intervocalic phenomena (e.g., lenition). A constraint like *VsV (Green &
Kenstowicz 1995) appears non-local, since [s] must look to both sides to decide
whether it can surface as s or must become z. However, a local reanalysis is
possible.
Sample reanalysis: For *VsV, say that /s/ always wants to surface as [z], but only
succeeds in the VsV context. For instance: ( cor and cont ) → voi rules out [s] in
favor of [z]. It is outranked by ]z → ( ]voi or V [ ), which says that any surface
[z] not underlyingly voiced is followed by a vowel, and also by the mirror image of
this, so that such a [z] must also be preceded by a vowel. Here ]z abbreviates
( ]cor and ]cont and ]voi ).

However, reduplication occupies a special role in phonology, in that it is inherently
non-local; it cannot be reanalyzed as local.
Therefore, to handle reduplication in OTP we need a representational trick (similar
to Clements 1985). Translate the Correspondence account of McCarthy & Prince
(1995) into OTP as follows:
17

d.

b dah-e
b dahb dah-e
[Red ][Base][Af]
b dahւ

Satisﬁes Max-IO, but violates surface constraint *VhV
Exact copy of this candidate’s base (enforced by Gen)

b dah-e
b dahb da -e
[Red ][Base][Af]
b da ւ

Satisﬁes Max-IO & *VhV, but not Dep-BR, i.e., C → C

b dah-e
b da b dah-e
[Red ][Base][Af]
b dahւ

Satisﬁes Max-IO & *VhV, but not Max-BR, i.e, C → C

Exact copy of this candidate’s base (enforced by Gen)

Exact copy of this candidate’s base (enforced by Gen)

In a language also requiring I-R faithfulness (McCarthy & Prince’s (1995)
Full Model), Gen must put two copies on the input tier: b dah b dah-e.
Haplology is a related example that may also be intrinsically non-local. (Yip 1995)
9. Constraints used for stress typology
See Eisner (1997a) for the OTP account of stress typology summarized in §8 above.
Undominated, prosodic-hierarchy constraints:

18

, ] F → ]σ
(says where feet can appear)
F [ → σ[
“Each foot is strictly built from syllables: it starts and ends on syllable edges
(perhaps the edges of diﬀerent syllables).”
b. Parse-σ: σ → F
(says where feet must appear)
“Every syllable overlaps with (roughly, is ‘linked to’) some foot.”
(37) a. Parse-F : F → x
(says where stress must appear)
“Any foot bears stress somewhere (overlaps with at least one stress mark).”

(36) a. Fill-F :

b. Fill-x(trochaic): x [ →

F[

,

]x → ]µ

,

x ⊥ ]σ

(says where stress can appear)

“Stress only appears at the start of a foot.”
“Stress ends on a mora boundary, so extends over some integral number of
moras.”
“Stress may not extend across (overlap with) a syllable boundary.”

The basic substantive constraints for secondary stress:
(38) Spread-x(trochaic): ]x ⊥

µw [

“Stress shouldn’t end immediately before a weak mora (but may spread onto it).”

(39) AntiLapse(σ): ( ]σ and

σ[

) → ( ]x or x [ )

“Every syllable boundary coincides with the edge of a stress mark. That is,
adjacent syllables must contrast for stress.”

(40) WeightEdge(iambic): ]F → ]µw (alternatively, ]x → ]µw )

“The stressed (right) edge of a foot should be supported by syllable weight, i.e., by
a weak mora.”

(41) FillWeight:

µw [

→ ( S [ or

µw [

)

“Don’t lengthen: weak moras on the surface must correspond to underlying
segments or weak moras.”

(42) StressAll: σ → x (alternatively, ]σ → ]F or

σ[

→

F[)

“Other things equal, have as many feet as possible (where feet and stresses are in
1-1 correspondence).”
(43) Branch(iambic): x [ ⊥ F [
[compare the iambic version of (37)]
“Just as the right edge of an iambic foot insists on stress, the left edge absolutely
rejects it. Hence stress may not consume the entire foot, but must alternate.”

Extrametricality and primary stress require additional constraints, given in the
paper.

BUT: To ﬁnd the optimal candidate is NP-hard on the size of the grammar (Eisner
1997b). So while the automaton algorithm above is usually eﬃcient, any algorithm
will be slow for a pathological grammar. This is unfortunate for learning theories
that may blunder into such a grammar and try to test it.
In addition to the algorithm to ﬁnd the optimal candidate, we can also characterize
the expressive power of OTP:
(44) a. Equal in power to OTFS, in which Gen is a ﬁnite-state transducer and the
constraints are arbitrary weighted FSAs. Any formal OTP grammar can be
converted to a formal OTFS grammar, and vice-versa.
However, the two grammars may have very diﬀerent constituent types
and constraint granularity. OTP grammars are more ﬁne-grained, so
they make stronger predictions about the eﬀect of reranking constraints.
b. More power than systems of ordered rewrite rules. The crucial example is
due to Bob Frank, Giorgio Satta, and Paul Smolensky—a funny trick that
OTP can do but ﬁnite-state transducers can’t.
c. Less power than if Generalized Alignment were allowed. The crucial
example is (34)—a funny trick that GA can do but OTP can’t.
11. What role do the primitive constraints play in OT?
Three kinds of constraints:
• Primitive: the implication and clash families.

• Compound: Expressible as a monolithic block of primitive constraints in ﬁxed
order. (Kennedy (1996) uses blocks of Align constraints.)

Q: Gen produces inﬁnitely many candidates. How do we ﬁnd the best?
A: By using intensional descriptions of the inﬁnite sets. For example, son → voi
≫ µw ⊥ voi yields “Utterances in which obstruent codas are voiceless and
sonorants are voiced.”
If we stick to the primitive constraints, we can use ﬁnite-state automata as our
intensional descriptions. E.g., the inﬁnite set of candidates that survive constraints
1–5 can be described in ﬁnite space with an automaton. Then we use constraint 6 to
narrow this set down further, etc.
(Strategy is due to Ellison (1994); Eisner (1997b) gives an eﬃcient version.)

• Complex: Any constraint not expressible in this restricted framework.
The balance among these remains to be seen. It is not yet clear what compound or
complex constraints are actually needed (and which of the primitive constraints are
not needed!).
We must also discover which of the formally possible primitive constraints are
favored in real languages (on phonetic or other grounds), and what rankings are
favored. OTP claims that languages use only local constraints; but it does not say
which local constraints.
Meanwhile,

19

20

• Primitive constraints are “safe to use.” They’re simple, radically local, and
ubiquitous.
• The restricted version of OT allowing only primitive constraints—called OTP—
is easy to reason within and is computationally tractable.
• OTP is the simplest explanation that stands a chance. Let’s reﬁne it against
the data, adding new core constraints only as we’re forced to.
• If OTP is close to correct, it may be fruitful to reanalyze languages and typologies within OTP. (For concreteness, see Eisner (1997a) for a detailed reanalysis of
stress typology that has some empirical beneﬁts.)
