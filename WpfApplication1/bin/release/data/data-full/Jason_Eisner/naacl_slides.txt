questions:
•

How do we reduce inference time to O(n)?

•

How do we decide which arcs to prune?

Arc Pruning

•

Prune arcs based on max-marginals.
maxmarginal(a) = max (y · w )
y :a∈y

•

Can compute using inside-outside algorithm.

•

Generic algorithm using hypergraph parsing.

Train a linear model with a loss function for pruning.

•

Regularized risk minimization with loss based on threshold

Implementation
Inference
•

Experiments use a highly-optimized C++ implementation.

•

Baseline ﬁrst-order parser processes 2000 tokens/sec.

•

Hypergraph parsing framework with shared inference.

Model
•

Final models trained with hamming-loss MIRA.

•

Full collection of dependency parsing features (Koo, 2010).

•

First-, second-, and third-order models match state-of-the-art.
