Abstract
We present two methods for incorporating detailed features in a Spanish parser,
building on a baseline model that is a lexicalized PCFG. The ﬁrst method exploits
Spanish morphology, and achieves an F1
constituency score of 83.6%. This is an
improvement over 81.2% accuracy for the
baseline, which makes little or no use of
morphological information. The second
model uses a reranking approach to add
arbitrary global features of parse trees to
the morphological model. The reranking
model reaches 85.1% F1 accuracy on the
Spanish parsing task. The resulting model
for Spanish parsing combines an approach
that speciﬁcally targets morphological information with an approach that makes
use of general structural features.

Introduction

Initial methods for statistical parsing were mainly
developed through experimentation on English data
sets. Subsequent research has focused on applying these methods to other languages. There has
been widespread evidence that new languages exhibit linguistic phenomena that pose considerable
challenges to techniques originally developed for
English; because of this, an important area of current research concerns how to model these phenomena more accurately within statistical approaches. In
this paper, we investigate this question within the
context of parsing Spanish. We describe two methods for incorporating detailed features in a Spanish
parser, building on a baseline model that is a lexicalized PCFG originally developed for English.
Our ﬁrst model uses morphology to improve
the performance of the baseline model. English
is a morphologically-impoverished language, while

most of the world’s languages exhibit far richer morphologies. Spanish is one of these languages. For
instance, the forms of Spanish nouns, determiners,
and adjectives reﬂect both number and gender; pronouns reﬂect gender, number, person, and case. Furthermore, morphological constraints may be manifested at the syntactic level: certain constituents of a
noun phrase are constrained to agree in number and
gender, and a verb is constrained to agree in number and person with its subject. Hence, morphology gives us important structural cues about how the
words in a Spanish sentence relate to one another.
The mechanism we employ for incorporating morphology into the PCFG model (the Model 1 parser
in (Collins, 1999)) is the modiﬁcation of its part-ofspeech (POS) tagset; in this paper, we explain how
this mechanism allows the parser to better capture
morphological constraints.
All of the experiments in this paper are carried
out using a freely-available Spanish treebank produced by the 3LB project (Navarro et al., 2003).
This resource contains around 3,500 hand-annotated
trees encoding ample morphological information.
We could not use all of this information and adequately train the resulting parameters due to limited training data. Hence, we used development
data to test the performance of several models, each
incorporating a subset of morphological information. The highest-accuracy model on the development set uses the mode and number of verbs,
as well as the number of adjectives, determiners,
nouns, and pronouns. On test data, it reaches
F1 accuracy of 83.6%/83.9%/79.4% for labeled
constituents, unlabeled dependencies, and labeled
dependencies, respectively. The baseline model,
which makes almost no use of morphology, achieves
81.2%/82.5%/77.0% in these same measures.
We use the morphological model from the aforementioned experiments as a base parser in a second
set of experiments. Here we investigate the efﬁcacy
of a reranking approach for parsing Spanish by using

arbitrary structural features. Previous work in statistical parsing (Collins and Koo, 2005) has shown
that applying reranking techniques to the n-best output of a base parser can improve parsing performance. Applying an exponentiated gradient reranking algorithm (Bartlett et al., 2004) to the n-best output of our morphologically-informed Spanish parsing model gives us similar improvements. Using the
reranking model combined with the morphological
model raises performance to 85.1%/84.7%/80.2%
F1 accuracy for labeled constituents, unlabeled dependencies, and labeled dependencies.

Related Work

The statistical parsing of English has surpassed 90%
accuracy in the precision and recall of labeled constituents (e.g., (Collins, 1999; Charniak and Johnson, 2005)). A recent proliferation of treebanks in
various languages has fueled research in the parsing of other languages. For instance, work has
been done in Chinese using the Penn Chinese Treebank (Levy and Manning, 2003; Chiang and Bikel,
2002), in Czech using the Prague Dependency Treebank (Collins et al., 1999), in French using the
French Treebank (Arun and Keller, 2005), in German using the Negra Treebank (Dubey, 2005; Dubey
and Keller, 2003), and in Spanish using the UAM
Spanish Treebank (Moreno et al., 2000). The bestreported F1 constituency scores from this work for
each language are 79.9% (Chinese (Chiang and
Bikel, 2002)), 81.0% (French (Arun and Keller,
2005), 76.2% (German (Dubey, 2005)), and 73.8%
(Spanish (Moreno et al., 2000)). The authors in
(Collins et al., 1999) describe an approach that gives
80% accuracy in recovering unlabeled dependencies
in Czech.1
The project that is arguably most akin to the work
presented in this paper is that on Spanish parsing
(Moreno et al., 2000). However, a direct comparison of scores is complicated by the fact that we have
used a different corpus as well as larger training and
test sets (2,800- vs. 1,500-sentence training sets, and
700- vs. 40-sentence test sets).

Note that cross-linguistic comparison of results is complicated: in addition to differences in corpus annotation schemes
and sizes, there may be signiﬁcant differences in linguistic characteristics.

Models

This section details our two approaches for adding
features to a baseline parsing model. First, we describe how morphological information can be added
to a parsing model by modifying the POS tagset.
Second, we describe an approach that reranks the
n-best output of the morphologically-rich parser, using arbitrary, general features of the parse trees as
additional information.
3.1

Adding Morphological Information

The mechanism we employ for incorporating morphological information is the modiﬁcation of the
POS tagset of a lexicalized PCFG2 — the Model 1
parser described in (Collins, 1999) (hereafter
Model 1). Each POS tagset can be thought of as a
particular morphological model or a subset of morphological attributes. Table 1 shows the complete set
of morphological features we considered for Spanish. There are 22 morphological features in total in
this table; different POS sets can be created by deciding whether or not to include each of these 22
features; hence, there are 222 different morphological models we could have created. For instance,
one particular model might capture the modal information of verbs. In this model, there would be six
POS tags for verbs (one for each of indicative, subjunctive, imperative, inﬁnitive, gerund, and participle) instead of just one. A model that captured both
the number and mode of verbs would have 18 verbal
POS tags, assuming three values (singular, plural,
and neutral) for the number feature.
The Effect of the Tagset on Model 1 Modifying
the POS tagset allows Model 1 to better distinguish

Hand-crafted head rules are used to lexicalize the trees.

o

events that are unlikely from those that are likely, on
the basis of morphological evidence. An example
will help to illustrate this point.
Model 1 relies on statistics conditioned on lexical headwords for practically all parameters in the
model. This sensitivity to headwords is achieved by
propagating lexical heads and POS tags to the nonterminals in the parse tree. Thus, any statistic based
on headwords may also be sensitive to the associated
POS tag. For instance, consider the subtree in Figure 1. Note that this structure is ungrammatical because the subject, gatos (cats), is plural, but the verb,
corri´ (ran), is singular. In Model 1, the probability
o
of generating the noun phrase (NP) with headword
gatos and headtag noun (n) is deﬁned as follows:3
P (gatos, n, NP | corri´ , v, S, VP) =
o
P1 (n, NP | corri´ , v, S, VP)×
o
P2 (gatos | n, NP, corri´ , v, S, VP)
o
The parser smooths parameter values using backedoff statistics, and in particular smooths statistics
based on headwords with coarser statistics based on
POS tags alone. This allows the parser to effectively
use POS tags as a way of separating different lexical items into subsets or classes depending on their
syntactic behavior. In our example, each term is estimated as follows:
P1 (n, NP | corri´ , v, S, VP) =
o
ˆ
λ1,1 P1,1 (n, NP | corri´ , v, S, VP) +
o
ˆ
λ1,2 P1,2 (n, NP | v, S, VP) +
ˆ
λ1,3 P1,3 (n, NP | S, VP)
and
P2 (gatos | n, NP, corri´ , v, S, VP) =
o
ˆ2,1 (gatos | n, NP, corri´ , v, S, VP) +
λ2,1 P
o
ˆ
λ2,2 P2,2 (gatos | n, NP, v, S, VP) +
ˆ
λ2,3 P2,3 (gatos | n)
3
Note that the parsing model includes other features such as
distance which we omit from the parameter deﬁnition for the
sake of brevity.

ˆ
Here the Pi,j terms are maximum likelihood estimates derived directly from counts in the training data. The λi,j parameters are deﬁned so that
λ1,1 +λ1,2 +λ1,3 = λ2,1 +λ2,2 +λ2,3 = 1. They control the relative contribution of each level of back-off
to the ﬁnal estimate.
Note that thus far our example has not included
any morphological information in the POS tags. Because of this, we will see that there is a danger of
the estimates P1 and P2 both being high, in spite
of the dependency being ungrammatical. P1 will be
ˆ
ˆ
ˆ
high because all three estimates P1,1 , P1,2 and P1,3
will most likely be high. Next, consider P2 . Of the
ˆ
ˆ
ˆ
ˆ
three estimates P2,1 , P2,2 , and P2,3 , only P2,1 retains
the information that the noun is plural and the verb
is singular. Thus P2 will be sensitive to the morphological clash between gatos and corri´ only if λ2,1 is
o
high, reﬂecting a high level of conﬁdence in the esˆ
timate of P2,3 . This will only happen if the context
corri´ , v, S, VP is seen frequently enough for λ2,1
o
to take a high value. This is unlikely, given that this
context is quite speciﬁc. In summary, the impoverished model can only capture morphological restrictions through lexically-speciﬁc estimates based on
extremely sparse statistics.
Now consider a model that incorporates morphological information — in particular, number information — in the noun and verb POS tags. gatos will
have the POS pn, signifying a plural noun; corri´
o
will have the POS sv, signifying a singular verb.
All estimates in the previous equations will reﬂect
these POS changes. For example, P1 will now be
estimated as follows:
P1 (pn, NP | corri´ , sv, S, VP) =
o
ˆ
λ1,1 P1,1 (pn, NP | corri´ , sv, S, VP) +
o
ˆ
λ1,2 P1,2 (pn, NP | sv, S, VP) +
ˆ
λ1,3 P1,3 (pn, NP | S, VP)
ˆ
ˆ
Note that the two estimates P1,1 and P1,2 include
an (unlikely) dependency between the POS tags pn
and sv. Both of these estimates will be 0, assuming that a plural noun is never seen as the subject of
a singular verb. At the very least, the context sv,
ˆ
S, VP will be frequent enough for P1,2 to be a reliable estimate. The value for λ1,2 will therefore be
high, leading to a low estimate for P1 , thus correctly
assigning low probability to the ungrammatical de-

pendency. In summary, the morphologically-rich
model can make use of non-lexical statistics such as
ˆ
P1,2 (pn, NP | sv, S, VP) which contain dependencies between POS tags and which will most likely
be estimated reliably by the model.
3.2

The Reranking Model

In the reranking model, we use an n-best version of
the morphologically-rich parser to generate a number of candidate parse trees for each sentence in
training and test data. These parse trees are then
represented through a combination of the log probability under the initial model, together with a large
number of global features. A reranking model uses
the information from these features to derive a new
ranking of the n-best parses, with the hope of improving upon the baseline model. Previous approaches (e.g., (Collins and Koo, 2005)) have used
a linear model to combine the log probability under a base parser with arbitrary features derived from
parse trees. There are a variety of methods for training the parameters of the model. In this work, we
use the algorithm described in (Bartlett et al., 2004),
which applies the large-margin training criterion of
support vector machines (Cortes and Vapnik, 1995)
to the reranking problem.
The motivation for the reranking model is that a
wide variety of features, which can essentially be
sensitive to arbitrary context in the parse trees, can
be incorporated into the model. In our work, we included all features described in (Collins and Koo,
2005). As far as we are aware, this is the ﬁrst time
that a reranking model has been applied to parsing
a language other than English. One goal was to investigate whether the improvements seen on English
parsing can be carried across to another language.
We have found that features in (Collins and Koo,
2005), initially developed for English parsing, also
give appreciable gains in accuracy when applied to
Spanish.

14% narrative, 11% commentary, 11% sports articles, 6% essays, and 5% articles from weekly magazines. The trees contain information about both constituency structure and syntactic functions.
4.1

Preprocessing

It is well-known that tree representation inﬂuences
parsing performance (Johnson, 1998). Prior to training our models, we made some systematic modiﬁcations to the corpus trees in an effort to make it easier for Model 1 to represent the linguistic phenomena present in the trees. For the convenience of the
reader, Table 2 gives a key to the non-terminal labels
in the 3LB treebank that are used in this section and
the remainder of the paper.
Relative and Subordinate Clauses Cases of relative and subordinate clauses appearing in the corpus
trees have the basic structure of the example in Figure 2a. Figure 2b shows the modiﬁcations we impose on such structures. The modiﬁed structure has
the advantage that the SBAR selects the CP node as
its head, making the relative pronoun que the headword for the root of the subtree. This change allows,
for example, better modeling of verbs that select for
particular complementizers. In addition, the new
subtree rooted at the S node now looks like a toplevel sentence, making sentence types more uniform
in structure and easier to model statistically. Additionally, the new structure differentiates phrases em-

like quien in Figure 2 to surface as lexical headwords when embedded in larger phrases beneath the

Coordination In the treebank, coordinated constituents and their coordinating conjunction are
placed as sister nodes in a ﬂat structure. We enhance
the structure of such subtrees, as in Figure 3. Our
structure helps to rule out unlikely phrases such as
cats and dogs and; the model trained with the original treebank structures will assign non-zero probability to ill-formed structures such as these.

Experiments

Our models were trained using a training set consisting of 80% of the data (2,801 sentence/tree pairs,
75,372 words) available to us in the 3LB treebank.
We reserved the remaining 20% (692 sentences,
19,343 words) to use as unseen data in a test set.
We selected these subsets with two criteria in mind:
ﬁrst, respecting the boundaries of the texts by placing articles in their entirety into either one subset or
the other; and second, maintaining, in each subset,
the same proportion of genres found in the original
set of trees. During development, we used a crossThis is achieved through our head rules.

validation approach on the training set to test different models. We divided the 2,800 training data trees
into 14 different development data sets, where each
of these data sets consisted of 2,600 training sentences and 200 development sentences. We took the
average over the results of the 14 splits to gauge the
effectiveness of the model being tested.
To evaluate our models, we considered the recovery of labeled and unlabeled dependencies as well as
labeled constituents. Unlabeled dependencies capture how the words in a sentence depend on one another. Formally, they are tuples {headchild index,
modiﬁer index}, where the indices indicate position
in the sentence. Labeled dependencies include the
labels of the modiﬁer, headchild, and parent nonterminals as well. The root of the tree has a special
dependency: {head index} in the unlabeled case and
{TOP, headchild index, root non-terminal} in the labeled case. The labeled constituents in a tree are all
of the non-terminals and, for each, the positions of
the words it spans. We use the standard deﬁnitions
of precision, recall, and F-measure.5
5

When extracting dependencies, we replaced all nonpunctuation POS labels with a generic label TAG to avoid conﬂating tagging errors with dependency errors. We also included
the structural changes that we imposed during preprocessing.
Results for constituent precision and recall were computed after we restored the trees to the original treebank structure.

5.1

The Effects of Morphology

In our ﬁrst experiments, we trained over 50 models, incorporating different morphological information into each in the way described in Section 3.1.
Prior to running the parsers, we trained the POS tagger described in (Collins, 2002). The output from
the tagger was used to assign a POS label for unknown words. We only attempted to parse sentences
under 70 words in length.
Table 3 describes some of the models we tried
during development and gives results for each. Our
baseline model, which we used to evaluate the effects of using morphology, was Model 1 (Collins,
1999) with a simple POS tagset containing almost
no morphological information. The morphological models we show are meant to be representative
of both the highest-scoring models and the performance of various morphological features. For instance, we found that, in general, gender had only a

slight impact on the performance of the parser. Note
that gender is not a morphological attribute of Spanish verbs, and that the inclusion of verbal features,
particularly number, mode, and person, generated
the strongest-performing models in our experiments.
Table 4 shows the results of running two models on the test set: the baseline model and the bestperforming morphological model from the development stage. This model uses the number and mode
of verbs, as well as the number of adjectives, determiners, nouns, and pronouns.
The results in Tables 3 and 4 show that adding
some amount of morphological information to a
parsing model is beneﬁcial. We found, however, that
adding more information does not always lead to improved performance (see, for example, rows 11 and
13 in Table 3). Presumably this is because the tagset
grows too large.
Table 5 takes a closer look at the performance

of the best-performing morphological model in the
recovery of particular labeled dependencies. The
breakdown shows the top 15 dependencies in the
gold-standard trees across the entire training set.
Collectively, these dependencies represent around
72% of the dependencies seen in this data.
We see an extraordinary gain in the recovery of
some of these dependencies when we add morphological information. Among these are the two involving postmodiﬁers to verbs. When examining the
output of the morphological model, we found that
much of this gain is due to the fact that there are two
non-terminal labels used in the treebank that specify
modal information of verbs they dominate (inﬁnitivals and gerunds): with insufﬁcient morphological
information, the baseline parser was unable to distinguish regular verb phrases from these more speciﬁc verb phrases.
Some dependencies are particularly difﬁcult for
the parser, such as that in which SBAR modiﬁes
a noun ({GRUP TAG SBAR R}). We found that
around 20% of cases of this type in the training set
involve structures like el proceso de negociones que
(in English the process of negotiation that). This
type of structure is inherently difﬁcult to disambiguate. In Spanish, such structures may be more
common than in English, since phrases involving
nominal modiﬁers to nouns, like negotiation process, are always formed as noun + de + noun.
5.2

Experiments with Reranking

In the reranking experiments, we follow the procedure described in (Collins and Koo, 2005) for creation of a training set with n-best parses for each
sentence. This method involves jack-kniﬁng the
data: the training set of 2,800 sentences was parsed
in 200-sentence chunks by an n-best morphological parser trained on the remaining 2,600 sentences.
This ensured that each sentence in the training data
had n-best output from a baseline model that was
not trained on that sentence. We used the optimal
morphological model (n(A,D,N,V,P)+m(V)) to generate the n-best lists, and we used the feature set described in (Collins and Koo, 2005). The test results
are given in Table 4.6

Note that we also created development sets for development of the reranking approach, and for cross-validation of the
single parameter C in approach of (Bartlett et al., 2004).

Table 5: Labeled dependency accuracy for the top 15 dependencies (representing around 72% of all dependencies) in the
gold-standard trees across all training data. The ﬁrst column
shows the type and subtype, where the subtype is speciﬁed as
the 4-tuple {parent non-terminal, head non-terminal, modiﬁer
non-terminal, direction}; the second column shows the count
for that subtype and the percent of the total that it represents
(where the total is 62,372) . The model BL is the baseline, and
M is the morphological model n(A,D,N,V,P)+m(V).

Statistical Signiﬁcance

We tested the signiﬁcance of the labeled precision
and recall results in Table 4 using the sign test.
When applying the sign test, for each sentence in
the test data we calculate the sentence-level F1 constituent score for the two parses being compared.
This indicates whether one model performs better
on that sentence than the other model, or whether
the two models perform equally well, information
used by the sign test. All differences were found to
be statistically signiﬁcant at the level p = 0.01.7

When comparing the baseline model to the morphological
model on the 692 test sentences, F1 scores improved on 314
sentences, and became worse on 164 sentences. When comparing the baseline model to the reranked model, 358/157 sen-

Conclusions and Future Work

We have developed a statistical parsing model for
Spanish that performs at 85.1% F1 constituency accuracy. We ﬁnd that an approach that explicitly
represents some of the particular features of Spanish (i.e., its morphology) does indeed help in parsing. Moreover, this approach is compatible with
the reranking approach, which uses general features that were ﬁrst developed for use in an English parser. In fact, our best parsing model combines both the language-speciﬁc morphological features and the non-speciﬁc reranking features. The
morphological features are local, being restricted to
dependencies between words in the parse tree; the
reranking features are more global, relying on larger
portions of parse structures. Thus, we see our ﬁnal
model as combining the strengths of two complementary approaches.
We are curious to know the extent to which a
close analysis of the dependency errors made by the
baseline parser can be corrected by the development
of features tailored to addressing these problems.
Some preliminary investigation of this suggests that
we see much higher gains when using generic features than these more speciﬁc ones, but we leave a
thorough investigation of this to future work. Another avenue for future investigation is to try using a
more sophisticated baseline model such as Collins’
Model 2, which incorporates both subcategorization
and complement/adjunct information. Finally, we
would like to use the Spanish parser in an application such as machine translation.
