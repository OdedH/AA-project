ABSTRACT

This study examines the role of several non–phonetic factors
in the reduction of ten frequent English function words ( I, and,
the, that, a , y o u, t o , o f , it, and in) in the phoneticallytranscribed portion of the Switchboard corpus of spontaneous
telephone conversations. Using ordinary linear and logistic
regression models, we examined the length of the words and
whether their vowels were full or reduced. We show that
function words are more likely to be longer or unreduced when
they are turn–initial or utterance–final, when the speaker is
female (mostly but not completely due to slower rate of
speech) and when the word is surprising given the previous or
following words. Finally, focusing on finer details of the
effect of planning problems on reduction, we show that filled
pauses (uh and u m ) are the strongest factor in predicting
lengthening of a previous function word. The results bear on
issues in speech recognition and models of speech production.
1. INTRODUCTION
This study reports on our continuing investigation into a
number of non–phonetic factors affecting the reduction of ten
of the most frequent English words—I, and, the, that, a, you,
to, of, it, and in—in the Switchboard corpus of conversational
telephone speech. Frequent function words are of particular
interest because they are not only subject to the contextual and
stylistic processes that govern the variation of content word
forms, but also typically exhibit additional variation,
especially a greater propensity toward reduced forms. Keating
(1997) showed that this greater variation in function words
was even more evident in Switchboard than in read–speech
databases like TIMIT.
Our study sheds more light on the role of two factors that
we looked at in Jurafsky et al. (1998):
•
planning problems: whether the speaker was having
difficulty in production, as previously indicated by
repetitions, pauses, and use of um and uh. In this paper we
studied the differential effect of these indicators.
•
predictability: the predictability of the function word,
modeled by its probability given the previous two words.
In this paper we studied the effect of the following word.
We also report on two new factors that play a role in the
reduction of function words.
•
age and sex: the age and sex of the speaker
•
position in turn and utterance: whether the
utterance was initial or final in the utterance and the turn.

2. METHODOLOGY
2.l Data
The Switchboard corpus of telephone conversations between
strangers was collected in the early 1990's (Godfrey et al.
1992). The corpus contains 2430 conversations averaging 6
minutes each, totaling 240 hours of speech and 3 million
words. Approximately four hours of this speech was
phonetically hand–transcribed by Greenberg et al. (1996). The
speech files were automatically segmented into
pseudo–utterances at turn boundaries or at silences of 500 ms
or more. The transcribers were given these utterances, the word
transcription, and a rough automatic phonetic transcription.
They then corrected this rough phonetic transcription, using
an augmented version of the arpabet. In general we relied on
these Berkeley transcriptions for our coding, although we did
listen to, recode, and/or eliminate certain observations;see
Jurafsky et al. (1998) for more details on the data coding.
2.2 Dependent Variables
We examined two dependent factors reflecting reduction:
vowel quality and word length . Vowel quality was a
categorical variable, coding whether a vowel was full or
reduced. The reduced vowels were « (arpabet [ax]), ö (arpabet
[ix]), «Õ (arpabet [axr]), and P (not in the arpabet). Word length
was the duration of the word in milliseconds.
2.3 Regression models
We used regression models to evaluate the effects of these
factors on the measures of reduction, logistic regression for
the categorical variable of vowel quality, ordinary linear
regression for length. Thus when we report that an effect was
significant, it is meant to be understood that it is a significant
parameter in a model that also includes the other significant
variables. In other words, after accounting for the effects of
the other variables, adding the variable in question produced a
significantly better account of the variation. Our models were
based on roughly 7300 to 8400 observations.
Logistic regression models the effect of explanatory
variables on a categorical variable in terms of the odds of the
category, which is the ratio of P(category) to 1–P(category).
For a binary category like full versus reduced vowel,we
estimate the odds by the ratio of the percentages of the two
values: the article a occurs with a full vowel 24% of the time,
and with a reduced vowel 76%; the odds of a full vowel are
24/76 = 0.3 (to one).

3.1 Rate of Speech
Speech researchers have long noted the association between
faster speech, informal styles, and more reduced forms. We
measured rate of speech at a given function word by taking the
number of syllables per second in the pause–bounded region
immediately surrounding the word; see Fosler–Lussier and
Morgan (1998) for more details on this coding.
Unsurprisingly, rate of speech affected all measures of
reduction. Comparing the difference between a relatively fast
rate of 7.5 syllables per second and a slow rate of 2.5 syllables
per second, the estimated increase in the odds of full to reduced
vowels was 3.7, i.e. the odds of a full vowel at the slow rate
was 3.7 times the odds at the faster rate (p < .0001).
3.2 Planning Problems
The production of speech is accompanied by a variety of
disfluencies. Some of these disfluencies are prospective,
largely due to speakers’ trouble in formulating an idea, and
expressing it with the proper syntax, words, prosody, and
articulation. Fox Tree and Clark (1997) suggested that such
‘planning problems’ cause words in immediately preceding
speech to have less reduced pronunciations. They found this to
be true for the.
We investigated the effects of planning problems on the
ten function words. Following earlier research, we took
disfluencies (pauses, filled pauses like u h or u m , and
repetitions) to be symptoms of planning problems; any
function word followed by one of these was assumed to belong
to a planning problem context. Disfluencies were not
infrequent, although they did vary by function word, as Table 1
shows.

The effect of a planning problem on word length was massive
and across–the–board (see Figure 1). The effect, both overall
and for each word, remains after partialing out effects of rate,
predictability, and next consonant/vowel (p < .0001). Words
are roughly twice as long before a disfluency than before a
word. All classes of vowels, basic, full, and reduced, are
lengthened.

3. OUR PREVIOUS RESULTS
In our previous work, we found four factors which
significantly affected reduction. We summarize those findings
here. Note that our previous work investigated a wider range of
dependent
variables,
including
whether
the
coda–consonant was present in it, that, of, and and, and
also distinguished two subtypes of unreduced pronunciations:
‘basic’ or ‘canonical’ pronunciations ([Qnd] for and) and

3.3 Following Consonant/Vowel
A general fact about weakening processes is that the form of a
word is influenced by the segmental context. More reduced
forms tend to occur before a consonant than before a vowel.
This is often modeled as allomorphy, e.g. the as [Di] before
vowels but [D«] before consonants (Keating 1994).
We found significantly less reduction (in all four
variables) when the next word began with a vowel than when it
began with a consonant. As expected, the odds of a basic [Di]
form of the were greatly increased before a vowel. However, to
and of were also similarly affected,suggesting an allomorphic
account of a [tu]/[t«] or [Ãv]/[«v] alternation.
3.4 Predictability and Collocation
Jespersen (1923) notes that the predictability of the word in
its context is an important factor contributing to weakened
pronunciations. To measure predictability, we estimated the
log of the conditional probability of a function word given the
previous two words using a backoff trigram grammar with
Good–Turing discounting trained over the entire Switchboard
corpus. Greater predictability increases the likelihood of
reduction. More predictable words were shorter than less
predictable words (p < .0001).
We also found collocational effects; the you of you know
was highly reduced, and the of in partitive constructions (kind
of, lots of, etc.) was significantly more likely (p < .001) to
have no coda than in other uses (such as thought of, outside
of). This suggests that the partitive construction may be
stored or unitized as a mental routine.
4. ACCENT
One of the strongest factors influencing the pronunciation of a
word is whether it receives accent. Since function words are
relatively unlikely to be accented, the lack of prosodic coding
in our corpus is not a great handicap. Nevertheless, when
accent does fall on a functor, it will be longer and have a fuller
pronunciation, and could thus be responsible for some of the
above effects. We listened to 120 instances of the functors,
concentrating on their longest full vowel tokens. Each item
was coded for presence or absence of pitch accent. About

5.1 Effect of age and sex on rate.
There is a large effect of sex on speaking rate (p < .0001). On
average men spoke 6.4% faster than women. Men had an
average rate of 5.35 syllables per second, and women an
average rate of 5.03 syllables per second. It is somewhat
surprising that such a similar difference is found for both read
speech and conversation.
We also found an effect of age on rate (p < .0001). Older
speakers spoke more slowly; 5.12 syllables per second for
speakers over 50, compared to 5.44 syllables per second for
speakers under 30.
Finally, there was an interaction of age and sex. While
women on average spoke more slowly than men, older women
spoke even more slowly than older men. Figure 2 shows all
these effects of age and sex on rate.
5.2 Effect of age and sex on disfluencies.
As expected from Shriberg’s (1999) research on the
Switchboard corpus, we found an effect of sex on disfluencies.
Men had a 16% higher odds of disfluencies than women. (The
raw rate of disfluency was 12.2% per word for men, and 10.9%

RATE

5. AGE AND SEX
Previous research has shown that sex is an important factor in
pronunciation variation. Byrd (1994), in her study of read
speech in the TIMIT corpus, found that men spoke on average
6.2% faster than women. Shriberg (1999), in her study of
disfluencies in Switchboard, found that men had slightly more
disfluencies per word than women. Besides this effect of sex,
we were interested in the role of age in pronunciation
variation. The age of Switchboard speakers at time of
recording ranged from 17 to 68.
Because of these previous results, we suspected that the
effects of sex and age on pronunciation would mostly be
realized through changes in speaking rate and disfluency rate.
We thus began by investigating the role of sex and age on
speaking rate and on the incidence of disfluencies. We then
looked at their remaining marginal effects on pronunciation.

for women.) Although there was no main effect of age, age and
sex again interacted. While younger men had a greater rate of
disfluencies than women (the odds of disfluencies were 64%
greater for 20–year old men than 20–year–old women), the
difference decreased with age, so that older men had
approximately the same disfluency rate as women.
If the effects of sex and age on speaking rate and
disfluencies are partialed out, is there any remaining effect on
pronunciation? There was a remaining small effect of sex (p =
.030) on word length (men's words were still 3% shorter), but
no remaining effect of age. For vowel reduction, however, the
remaining effect of sex is much stronger (p < .0001).

one–third of the items were coded independently by two
listeners, and of the other two–thirds, any low–confidence
tokens were considered by the other listener also.
Only four functors had more than one accented token out
of ten: I, 12 of 20; you, 7 of 15; that, 4 of 15; and and, 2 of
10. Since these are sampled from the longer tokens, overall
frequencies of accent will be much lower. For these items we
cannot rule out the possibility that accented tokens occur
disproportionately in one or more of our predictor contexts.
For the disfluency contexts, accented and and that occurred
equally in our sample before words or before disfluencies;
accented I and you occurred slightly more frequently in the
disfluent contexts, but the difference for this small sample was
far from significant. We cannot rule out that accent may be
found to interact with our other effects in a larger sample, of
course, but the magnitude and the scope of its influence on our
results appears to be limited.

6. PREDICTABILITY
Our previous work showed that words are shorter and more
reduced when they are predictable (i.e. when they have a high
trigram probability given the previous two words). We were
interested in whether the following word could play a role in
predictability, since the speaker is presumably already
planning the next word when the current word is articulated.
We examined the centered trigram probability (the
log probability of a function word given the previous and the
following word using the methods described in §3.4. We found
significant effects for both the trigram and centered trigram
probabilities. Function words averaged 83 ms shorter when
they were highly predictable by a standard trigram (p(word) =
.56) than when they were highly unpredictable by a standard
trigram (p(word) = .0056). After partialing out this effect of
standard trigram, function words were still 31 ms shorter when
they were highly predictable by a centered trigram (p(word ) =
.56) than when they were highly unpredictable by a centered
trigram (p(word) = .00000056).
7. POSITION IN TURN AND UTTERANCE
Previous research has shown the importance of the position of
a word in its turn or utterance, particularly of initial and final
position. Phrase–final lengthening is a well–known factor.
Research on repair (Fox and Jasperson 1995 inter alia) has
suggested that planning problems may tend to be located early
in turns. An analysis of errors in automatic speech recognition

of Switchboard (Jurafsky et al. 1998b) showed that
utterance–initial words were more often misrecognized.
We examined the effect of word position on reduction and
on the likelihood of disfluencies. We coded each word for its
position in the turn and in the utterance, following the
definitions of turn and utterance used in the Penn Treebank
annotation of Switchboard (Meteer et al 1995).
Both turn–initial and utterance–final words are
significantly longer than other words. Much of the effect of
turn position on length is realized via an increased disfluency
rate (disfluency odds ratio of 1.41 for turn–initial position,
and of 4.42 for utterance–final position). (Unlike Shriberg
(1999), we did not find that disfluencies are significantly more
likely to occur utterance–initially.) But even after factoring
out the effect of disfluencies on reduction, turn–initial words
were still 20% longer than non–turn–initial words, and
utterance–final words were still 35% longer than
non–utterance–final words.
8. DISFLUENCIES
Does the powerful effect of disfluent items on the preceding
function word extend to each of the categories—pause, filled
pause, and repetition—that we used as indicators of planning
problems? Earlier work by O’Shaughnessy (1992) and Girand
et al. (1998) suggested that it might not, since they found that
much of the lengthening of a word preceding its repetition was
due to lengthening occurring when pauses fell between the
repeated words.
An item analysis for the three categories found somewhat
different results. First, silent pauses, filled pauses, and
repetition each contribute strongly to the longer and less
reduced forms found before them. Second, filled pauses, not
silent pauses, have the strongest effect. Third, while the effect
of silence was greater than that of repetition, it was only
marginally significant (p = .040). Although our assessment of
these effects was carried out after partialing out effects of rate,

for simplicity we summarize them by reporting raw durations
and odds of reduction in the table below. The relatively smaller
effect for pauses is not necessarily inconsistent with the prior
results; since they concerned pauses within repetition strings.
9. CONCLUSION
This study has measured the affect of a number of
non–phonetic factors on the reduction of ten English function
words in the Switchboard corpus. Function words are more
likely to be unreduced when they are turn–initial or
utterance–final. Female speakers are more likely to have long
or unreduced function words; this effect is mostly but not

completely due to their slightly slower speaking rate. Finally,
focusing on finer details of the effect of planning problems on
reduction, we show that filled pauses (uh and um) are the
strongest factor in predicting lengthening of a previous
function word.
It is interesting that these factors are all extremely local,
mostly involving the immediately previous or following
word, an immediately previous or following turn or utterance
boundary, or the immediate rate of speech in a very local
region. In terms of cognitive models of speech production,
while some of these effects are likely to arise at the levels of
lexical retrieval and compilation of syntactic and prosodic
frames, others will require more immediate access to the
articulatory routines. Whatever the sources of the effects, the
results hold out the hope for speech engineering of building
good predictive models of word pronunciation based only on
very local information.
