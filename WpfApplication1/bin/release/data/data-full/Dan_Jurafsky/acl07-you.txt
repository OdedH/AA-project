Abstract
We describe an algorithm for a novel task: disambiguating the pronoun you in conversation. You can
be generic or referential; ﬁnding referential you is important for tasks such as addressee identiﬁcation or
extracting ‘owners’ of action items. Our classiﬁer
achieves 84% accuracy in two-person conversations;
an initial study shows promising performance even on
more complex multi-party meetings.

Introduction and Background

This paper describes an algorithm for disambiguating the generic and referential senses of the pronoun
you.
Our overall aim is the extraction of action items
from multi-party human-human conversations, concrete decisions in which one (or more) individuals
take on a group commitment to perform a given task
(Purver et al., 2006). Besides identifying the task itself, it is crucial to determine the owner, or person
responsible. Occasionally, the name of the responsible party is mentioned explicitly. More usually, the
owner is addressed directly and therefore referred to
using a second-person pronoun, as in example (1). 1
A:

(1)
B:

and um if you can get that binding point also
maybe with a nice example that would be helpful
for Johno and me.
Oh yeah uh O K.

It can also be important to distinguish between
singular and plural reference, as in example (2)
where the task is assigned to more than one person:
A:

B:

So y- so you guys will send to the rest of us um a
version of um, this, and - the - uh, description With sugge- yeah, suggested improvements and -

Use of “you” might therefore help us both in de∗

tecting the fact that a task is being assigned, and in
identifying the owner. While there is an increasing body of work concerning addressee identiﬁcation (Katzenmaier et al., 2004; Jovanovic et al.,
2006), there is very little investigating the problem
of second-person pronoun resolution, and it is this
that we address here. Most cases of “you” do not in
fact refer to the addressee but are generic, as in example (3); automatic referentiality classiﬁcation is
therefore very important.

Well, usually what you do is just wait until you
think it’s stopped,
and then you patch them up.

Related Work

Previous linguistic work has recognized that “you”
is not always addressee-referring, differentiating between generic and referential uses (Holmes, 1998;
Meyers, 1990) as well as idiomatic cases of “you
know”. For example, (Jurafsky et al., 2002) found
that “you know” covered 47% of cases, the referential class 22%, and the generic class 27%, with no
signiﬁcant differences in surface form (duration or
vowel reduction) between the different cases.
While there seems to be no previous work investigating automatic classiﬁcation, there is related work
on classifying “it”, which also takes various referen¨
tial and non-referential readings: (Muller, 2006) use
lexical and syntactic features in a rule-based classiﬁer to detect non-referential uses, achieving raw
accuracies around 74-80% and F-scores 63-69%.

Data

We used the Switchboard corpus of two-party telephone conversations (Godfrey et al., 1992), and annotated the data with four classes: generic, referential singular, referential plural and a reported referential class, for mention in reported speech of an

of “you”. We also investigated using the presence
of a question mark in the transcription as a feature,
as a possible replacement for some dialog act features. Table 2 presents our features in detail.

originally referential use (as the original addressee
may not be the current addressee – see example (4)).
We allowed a separate class for genuinely ambiguous cases. Switchboard explicitly tags “you know”
when used as a discourse marker; as this (generic)
case is common and seems trivial we removed it
from our data.

Features

All features used for classiﬁer experiments were
extracted from the Switchboard LDC Treebank 3
release, which includes transcripts, part of speech
information using the Penn tagset (Marcus et al.,
1994) and dialog act tags (Jurafsky et al., 1997).
Features fell into four main categories:2 sentential features which capture lexical features of the
utterance itself; part-of-speech features which capture shallow syntactic patterns; dialog act features
capturing the discourse function of the current utterance and surrounding context; and context features which give oracle information (i.e., the correct generic/referential label) about preceding uses

Well, uh, I guess probably the last one I went to I
met so many people that I had not seen in probably ten, over ten years.
It was like, don’t you remember me.
And I am like no.
Am I related to you?

To test inter-annotator agreement, two people annotated 4 conversations, yielding 85 utterances containing “you”; the task was reported to be easy, and
the kappa was 100%.
We then annotated a total of 42 conversations for
training and 13 for testing. Different labelers annotated the training and test sets; none of the authors were involved in labeling the test set. Table 1
presents information about the number of instances
of each of these classes found.

Experiments and Results

As Table 1 shows, there are very few occurrences
of the referential plural, reported referential and ambiguous classes. We therefore decided to model our
problem as a two way classiﬁcation task, predicting
generic versus referential (collapsing referential singular and plural as one category). Note that we expect this to be the major useful distinction for our
overall action-item detection task.
Baseline A simple baseline involves predicting the
dominant class (in the test set, referential). This
gives 54.59% accuracy (see Table 1).3
SVM Results We used LIBSVM (Chang and Lin,
2001), a support vector machine classiﬁer trained
using an RBF kernel. Table 3 presents results for

Surprisingly, using the oracle context features (the
correct classiﬁcation for the previous you) alone performs worse than the baseline; and adding these features to sentential features gives no improvement.
This suggests that the generic/referential status of
each you may be independent of previous yous.

various selected sets of features. The best set of features gave accuracy of 84.39% and f-score 84.21%.

We used manually produced dialog act tags, and
automatic labeling accuracy with this ﬁne-grained
tagset will be low; we would therefore prefer to
use more robust features if possible. We found that
one such heuristic feature, the presence of question mark, cannot entirely substitute: accuracy is
reduced to 76.3%. However, using only the binary
Q DA feature (which clusters together all the different kinds of question DAs) does better (79.19%).
Although worse than performance with a full tagset,
this gives hope that using a coarse-grained set of
tags might allow reasonable results. As (Stolcke et
al., 2000) report good accuracy (87%) for statement
vs. question classiﬁcation on manual Switchboard
transcripts, such coarse-grained information might
be reliably available.

Discussion Overall performance is respectable;
precision was consistently high (94% for the
highest-accuracy result). Perhaps surprisingly, none
of the context or part-of-speech features were found
to be useful; however, dialog act features proved
very useful – using these features alone give us
an accuracy of 80.92% – with the referential class
strongly associated with question dialog acts.

Prosodic Features

We next checked a set of prosodic features, testing the hypothesis that generics are prosodically reduced. Mean pitch, intensity and duration were extracted using Praat, both averaged over the entire
utterance and just for the word “you”. Classiﬁcation results are shown in Table 4. Using only
prosodic features performs below the baseline; including prosodic features with the best-performing
feature set from Table 3 gives identical performance
to that with lexical and contextual features alone.
To see why the prosodic features did not help, we
examined the difference between the average pitch,
intensity and duration for referential versus generic
cases (Table 5). A one-sided t-test shows no significant differences between the average intensity and
duration (conﬁrming the results of (Jurafsky et al.,
2002), who found no signiﬁcant change in duration).
The difference in the average pitch was found to be
signiﬁcant (p=0.2) – but not enough for this feature
alone to cause an increase in overall accuracy.

Error Analysis

We performed an error analysis on our best classiﬁer output on the training set; accuracy was 94.53%,
giving a total of 36 errors.
Half of the errors (18 of 36) were ambiguous even
for humans (the authors), if looking at the sentence
alone without the neighboring context from the actual conversation – see (5a). Treating these examples thus needs a detailed model of dialog context.
The other major class of errors requires detailed

knowledge about sentential semantics and/or the
world – see e.g. (5b,c), which we can tell are referential because they predicate inter-personal comparison or communication.
In addition, as questions are such a useful feature
(see above), the classiﬁer tends to label all question
cases as referential. However, generic uses do occur
within questions (5d), especially if rhetorical (5e):
(5) a. so uh and if you don’t have the money then use a
credit card
b. I’m probably older than you
c. although uh I will personally tell you I used to work
at a bank
d. Do they survive longer if you plant them in the winter
time?
e. my question I guess are they really your peers?

Initial Multi-Party Experiments

The experiments above used two-person dialog data:
we expect that multi-party data is more complex. We
performed an initial exploratory study, applying the
same classes and features to multi-party meetings.
Two annotators labeled one meeting from the
AMI corpus (Carletta et al., 2006), giving a total of
52 utterances containing “you” on which to assess
agreement: kappa was 87.18% for two way classiﬁcation of generic versus referential. One of the
authors then labeled a testing set of 203 utterances;
104 are generic and 99 referential, giving a baseline
accuracy of 51.23% (and F-score of 67.65%).
We performed experiments for the same task: detecting generic versus referential uses. Due to the
small amount of data, we trained the classiﬁer on the
Switchboard training set from section 3 (i.e. on twoparty rather than multi-party data). Lacking part-ofspeech or dialog act features (since the dialog act
tagset differs from the Switchboard tagset), we used
only the sentential, context and question mark features described in Table 2.
However, the classiﬁer still achieves an accuracy
of 73.89% and F-score of 74.15%, comparable to the
results on Switchboard without dialog act features
(accuracy 76.30%). Precision is lower, though (both
precision and recall are 73-75%).

Conclusions

We have presented results on two person and multiparty data for the task of generic versus referential
“you” detection. We have seen that the problem is

a real one: in both datasets the distribution of the
classes is approximately 50/50, and baseline accuracy is low. Classiﬁer accuracy on two-party data is
reasonable, and we see promising results on multiparty data with a basic set of features. We expect the
accuracy to go up once we train and test on samegenre data and also add features that are more speciﬁc to multi-party data.
