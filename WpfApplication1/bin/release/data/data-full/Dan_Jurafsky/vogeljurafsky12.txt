Abstract
Studies of gender balance in academic
computer science are typically based on
statistics on enrollment and graduation.
Going beyond these coarse measures of
gender participation, we conduct a ﬁnegrained study of gender in the ﬁeld of
Natural Language Processing. We use
topic models (Latent Dirichlet Allocation)
to explore the research topics of men and
women in the ACL Anthology Network.
We ﬁnd that women publish more on dialog, discourse, and sentiment, while men
publish more than women in parsing, formal semantics, and ﬁnite state models. To
conduct our study we labeled the gender
of authors in the ACL Anthology mostly
manually, creating a useful resource for
other gender studies. Finally, our study
of historical patterns in female participation shows that the proportion of women
authors in computational linguistics has
been continuously increasing, with approximately a 50% increase in the three
decades since 1980.

Introduction

The gender imbalance in science and engineering
is particularly striking in computer science, where
the percentage of graduate students in computer
science that are women seems to have been declining rather than increasing recently (Palma, 2001;
Beaubouef and Zhang, 2011; Spertus, 1991; Hill
et al., 2010; Singh et al., 2007).
While many studies have examined enrollment
and career advancement, less attention has been
paid to gender differences in scientiﬁc publications. This paper studies author gender in the Association for Computational Linguistics Anthology Network (AAN) corpus (Radev et al., 2009),

(based on the ACL Anthology Reference Corpus
(Bird et al., 2008)) from which we used 13,000
papers by approximately 12,000 distinct authors
from 1965 to 2008.
The AAN corpus disambiguates author names,
but does not annotate these names for gender. We
ﬁrst performed a mostly-manual annotation of the
gender of each author (details in Section 2). We
make these annotation available as a useful resource for other researchers.1
We then study a number of properties of the
ACL authors. We ﬁrst address surface level questions regarding the balance of genders in publications. In 2008, women were granted 20.5%
of computer science PhDs (CRA, 2008). Does
this ratio hold also for the percentages of papers
written by women in computational linguistics as
well? We explore differences in publication count
between genders, looking at total publications and
normalized values like publications per year and
trends over time.
Going beyond surface level analysis, we then
turn to document content. We utilize Latent
Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic models (Blei et
al., 2003) to study the difference in topics that men
and women write about.

Determining Gender

The gender of an author is in general difﬁcult
to determine automatically with extremely high
precision. In many languages, there are genderdifferentiated names for men and women that can
make gender-assignment possible based on gendered name dictionaries. But the fact that ACL
authors come from many different language background makes this method prone to error. For
example, while U.S. Census lists of frequently
occurring names by gender (Census, 2012) can

resolve a large proportion of commonly occurring names from authors in the United States and
Canada, they incorrectly list the name “Jan” as female. It turns out that authors in the ACL Anthology who are named “Jan” are in fact male,
since the name is a very common male name in
many parts of Europe, and since US female researchers named “Jan” often use the full form of
their name rather than the shortening “Jan” when
publishing. Furthermore, a signiﬁcant percentage
of ACL authors have Chinese language names,
which are much less clearly linked with personal
names (e.g., Weiwei Sun is female whereas Weiwei Ding is male).
We found that Chinese names as well as ambiguous names like “Jan” were poorly predicted
by online name gender website algorithms we
looked at, leading to a high error rate. To insure
high precision, we therefore instead chose to annotate the authors in the corpus with a high-precision
method; mainly hand labeling the names but also
using some automatic help.
We used unambiguous name lists for various
languages to label a large proportion of the name;
for example we used the subset of given names
(out of the 4221 ﬁrst names reported in the 1990
U.S. Census) that were unambiguous (occurring
consistently with only one gender in all of our
name lists) used morphological gender for languages like Czech or Bulgarian which mark morphological gender on names, and relied on lists
of Indian and Basque names (from which we had
removed any ambiguous names). For all ambiguous names, we next used our personal cognizance of many of the ACL authors, also asking for help from ACL researchers in China, Taiwan, and Singapore (to help label Chinese names
of researchers they were familiar with) and other
researchers for help on the Japanese and Korean
names. Around 1100 names were hand-labeled
from personal cognizance or photos of the ACL
researchers on their web pages. The combination of name lists and personal cognizance left
only 2048 names (15% of the original 12,692)
still unlabeled. We then used a baby name website, www.gpeters.com/names/, originally
designed for reporting the popularity and gender
balance of ﬁrst names, to ﬁnd the gender of 1287
of these 2048 names.2 The remaining 761 names

Overall Statistics

We ﬁrst discuss some overall gender statistics for
the ACL Anthology. Figure 1 shows the number
of authors of each gender. Men comprised 8573
of the 12692 authors (67.5%) and there were 3359
female authors (26.5%). We could not conﬁdently
determine the gender of 761 out of 12692 (6.0%)
of the authors. Some of these are due to single letter ﬁrst names or problems with ill-formatted data.
Table 1 lists the number of papers for each gender. About twice as many papers had at least one
male author (64%) as had at least one female author (33%). The statistics for ﬁrst authorship were
slightly more skewed; women were the ﬁrst author of 27% of papers, whereas men ﬁrst authored
71%. In papers with at least one female author, the
ﬁrst author was a woman 60% of the time, whereas
papers with at least one male author had a male
higher than the average for the whole corpus.

ﬁrst author 80% of the time. Thus men not only
write more papers, but are also more frequently
ﬁrst authors.

Figure 2: The number of authors of a given gender
for a given year.
Figure 2 shows gender statistics over time, giving the number of authors of a given gender for a
given year. An author is considered active for a
year if he or she was an author of at least one paper. The number of both men and women authors
increases over the years, reﬂecting the growth of
computational linguistics.
Figure 3 shows the percentage of authors of a
given gender over time. We overlay a linear regression of authorship percentage for each gender
showing that the proportion of women is growing over time. The male best ﬁt line has equation y = −0.3025x + 675.49(R2 = 0.41, p =
1.95 · 10−5 ) and the female best ﬁt line is y =
0.3429x − 659.48(R2 = 0.51, p = 1.48 · 10−5 ).
Female authorship percentage grew from 13% in
1980 to 27% in 2007, while male authorship percentage decreased from 79% in 1980 to 71% in
2007. Using the best ﬁt lines as a more robust
estimate, female authorship grew from 19.4% to
29.1%, a 50% relative increase.
This increase of the percentage of women authorship is substantial. Comparable numbers do
not seem to exist for computer science in general, but according to the CRA Taulbee Surveys
of computer science (CRA, 2008), women were
awarded 18% of the PhDs in 2002 and 20.5% in
2007. In computational linguistics in the AAN,
women ﬁrst-authored 26% of papers in 2002 and
27% of papers in 2007. Although of course these
numbers are not directly comparable, they at least
suggest that women participate in computational
linguistics research at least as much as in the gen-

eral computer science population and quite possibly signiﬁcantly more.
We next turn attention to how the most proliﬁc
authors of each gender compare. Figure 4 shows
the number of papers published by the top 400 authors of each gender, sorted in decreasing order.
We see that the most proliﬁc authors are men.
There is an important confound in interpreting
the number of total papers by men and the statistics on proliﬁc authors. Since, as Figure 3 shows,
there was a smaller proportion of women in the
ﬁeld in the early days of computational linguistics,
and since authors publish more papers the longer
they are in the ﬁeld, it’s important to control for
length of service.
Figure 5 shows the average number of active
years for each gender. An author is considered active in the years between his or her ﬁrst and last
publication in the anthology. Comparing the number of years of service for each gender, we ﬁnd
that on average men indeed have been in the ﬁeld
longer (t-test, p = 10−6 ).
Accounting for this fact, Figure 6 shows the
average number of publications per active year.
Women published an average of 1.07 papers per
year active, while men published 1.03 papers per
active year. This difference is signiﬁcant (t-test,
p = 10−3 ), suggesting that women are in fact
slightly more proliﬁc than men per active year.
In the ﬁeld of Ecology, Sih and Nishikawa
(1988) found that men and women published
roughly the same number of papers per year of
service. They used a random sample of 100 researchers in the ﬁeld. In contrast, Symonds et al.
(2006) found that men published more papers per
year than women in ecology and evolutionary biology. This study also used random sampling, so
it is unclear if the differing results are caused by a
sampling error or by some other source.

Topic Models

In this section we discuss the relationship between
gender and document content. Our main tool is
Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), a model of the
topics in a document. We brieﬂy describe LDA;
see (Blei et al., 2003) for more details. LDA
is a generative model of documents, which models documents as a multinomial mixture of topics,
which in turn are multinomial distributions over
words. The generative story proceeds as follows:
a document ﬁrst picks the number of words N it

will contain and samples a multinomial topic distribution p(z|d) from a Dirichlet prior. Then for
each word to be generated, it picks a topic z for
that word, and then a word from the multinomial
distribution p(w|z).
Following earlier work like Hall et al. (2008),
we ran LDA (Blei et al., 2003) on the ACL Anthology, producing 100 generative topics. The
second author and another senior expert in the
ﬁeld (Christopher D. Manning) collaboratively assigned labels to each of the 100 topics including
marking those topics which were non-substantive
(lists of function words or afﬁxes) to be elimi-

nated. Their consensus labeling eliminated 27 topics, leaving 73 substantive topics.
In this study we are interested in how documents written by men and women differ. We are
mainly interested in Pr(Z|G), the probability of a
topic being written about by a given gender, and
Pr(Z|Y, G), the probability of a topic being written about by a particular gender in a given year.
Random variable Z ranges over topics, Y over
years, and G over gender. Our topic model gives
us Pr(z|d), where d is a particular document. For
a document d ∈ D, let dG be the gender of the ﬁrst
author, and dY the year it was written.

To compute Pr(z|g), we sum over documents
whose ﬁrst author is gender g:
Pr(z|g) =

Pr(z|d) Pr(d|g)
{d∈D|dG =g}

=
{d∈D|dG =g}

Pr(z|d)
|{d ∈ D|dG = g}|

To compute Pr(z|y, g), we additionally condition on the year a document was written:
Pr(z|y, g) =

Pr(z|d) Pr(d|y, g)
{d∈D|dY =y}

=
{d∈D|dY =y,dG =g}

Pr(z|d)
|{d ∈ D|dY = y, dG = g}|

To determine ﬁelds in which one gender publishes more than another, we compute the oddsratio
Pr(z|g = female)(1 − Pr(z|g = female))
Pr(z|g = male)(1 − Pr(z|g = male))
for each of the 73 topics in our corpus.

Topic Modeling Results

Using the odds-ratio deﬁned above, we computed
the top eight male and female topics. The top
female-published topics are speech acts + BDI,
prosody, sentiment, dialog, verb subcategorization, summarization, anaphora resolution, and tutoring systems. Figure 9 shows the top words for
each of those topics. Figure 7 shows how they
have evolved over time.
The top male-published topics are categorial
grammar + logic, dependency parsing, algorithmic

efﬁciency, parsing, discriminative sequence models, uniﬁcation based grammars, probability theory, and formal semantics. Figure 8 and 10 display
these topics over time and their associated words.
There are interesting possible generalizations in
these topic differences. At least in the ACL corpus, women tend to publish more in speech, in social and conversational topics, and in lexical semantics. Men tend to publish more in formal
mathematical approaches and in formal syntax and
semantics.
Of course the fact that a certain topic is more
linked with one gender doesn’t mean the other
gender does not publish in this topic. In particular, due to the larger number of men in the ﬁeld,
there can be numerically more male-authored papers in a female-published topic. Instead, what our
analysis yields are topics that each gender writes
more about, when adjusted by the number of papers published by that gender in total.
Nonetheless, these differences do suggest that
women and men in the ACL corpus may, at least
to some extent, exhibit some gender-speciﬁc tendencies to favor different areas of research.

Conclusion

Our study of gender in the ACL Anthology shows
important gains in the percentage of women in the
ﬁeld over the history of the ACL (or at least the last
30 years of it). More concretely, we ﬁnd approximately a 50% increase in the proportion of female authors since 1980. While women’s smaller
numbers means that they have produced less total papers in the anthology, they have equal (or
even very slightly higher) productivity of papers
per year.
In topics, we do notice some differing tendencies toward particular research topics. In current
work, we are examining whether these differences
are shrinking over time, as a visual overview of
Figure 7 seems to suggest, which might indicate
that gender balance in topics is a possible outcome, or possibly that topics ﬁrst addressed by
women are likely to to be taken up by male researchers. Additionally, other applications of topic
models to the ACL Anthology allow us to study
the topics a single author publishes in over time
(Anderson et al., 2012). These techniques would
allow us to study how gender relates to an author’s
topics throughout his or her career.
