Abstract
Automatically extracting social meaning and
intention from spoken dialogue is an important task for dialogue systems and social computing. We describe a system for detecting
elements of interactional style: whether a
speaker is awkward, friendly, or ﬂirtatious.
We create and use a new spoken corpus of 991
4-minute speed-dates. Participants rated their
interlocutors for these elements of style. Using rich dialogue, lexical, and prosodic features, we are able to detect ﬂirtatious, awkward, and friendly styles in noisy natural conversational data with up to 75% accuracy,
compared to a 50% baseline. We describe simple ways to extract relatively rich dialogue features, and analyze which features performed
similarly for men and women and which were
gender-speciﬁc.

Introduction

How can we extract social meaning from speech, deciding if a speaker is particularly engaged in the conversation, is uncomfortable or awkward, or is particularly friendly and ﬂirtatious? Understanding these
meanings and how they are signaled in language is
an important sociolinguistic task in itself. Extracting
them automatically from dialogue speech and text
is crucial for developing socially aware computing
systems for tasks such as detection of interactional
problems or matching conversational style, and will
play an important role in creating more natural dialogue agents (Pentland, 2005; Nass and Brave, 2005;
Brave et al., 2005).

Cues for social meaning permeate speech at every
level of linguistic structure. Acoustic cues such as
low and high F0 or energy and spectral tilt are important in detecting emotions such as annoyance, anger,
sadness, or boredom (Ang et al., 2002; Lee and
Narayanan, 2002; Liscombe et al., 2003), speaker
characteristics such as charisma (Rosenberg and
Hirschberg, 2005), or personality features like extroversion (Mairesse et al., 2007; Mairesse and Walker,
2008). Lexical cues to social meaning abound.
Speakers with links to depression or speakers who
are under stress use more ﬁrst person singular pronouns (Rude et al., 2004; Pennebaker and Lay, 2002;
Cohn et al., 2004), positive emotion words are cues
to agreeableness (Mairesse et al., 2007), and negative emotion words are useful cues to deceptive
speech (Newman et al., 2003). The number of words
in a sentence can be a useful feature for extroverted
personality (Mairesse et al., 2007). Finally, dialog features such as the presence of disﬂuencies
can inform listeners about speakers’ problems in utterance planning or about conﬁdence (Brennan and
Williams, 1995; Brennan and Schober, 2001).
Our goal is to see whether cues of this sort are
useful in detecting particular elements of conversational style and social intention; whether a speaker
in a speed-dating conversation is judged by the interlocutor as friendly, awkward, or ﬂirtatious.

The Corpus

Our experiments make use of a new corpus we have
collected, the SpeedDate Corpus. The corpus is
based on three speed-dating sessions run at an elite

private American university in 2005 and inspired
by prior speed-dating research (Madan et al., 2005;
Pentland, 2005). The graduate student participants
volunteered to be in the study and were promised
emails of persons with whom they reported mutual
liking. Each date was conducted in an open setting
where there was substantial background noise. All
participants wore audio recorders on a shoulder sash,
thus resulting in two audio recordings of the approximately 1100 4-minute dates. In addition to the audio, we collected pre-test surveys, event scorecards,
and post-test surveys. This is the largest sample we
know of where audio data and detailed survey information were combined in a natural experiment.
The rich survey information included date perceptions and follow-up interest, as well as general attitudes, preferences, and demographic information. Participants were also asked about the
conversational style and intention of the interlocutor. Each speaker was asked to report how often their date’s speech reﬂected different conversational styles (awkward, friendly, ﬂirtatious, funny,
assertive) on a scale of 1-10 (1=never, 10=constantly): “How often did the other person behave in
the following ways on this ‘date’?”. We chose three
of these ﬁve to focus on in this paper.
We acquired acoustic information by taking the
acoustic wave ﬁle from each recorder and manually
segmenting it into a sequence of waveﬁles, each corresponding to one 4-minute date. Since both speakers wore microphones, most dates had two recordings, one from the male recorder and one from the
female recorder. Because of mechanical, operator, and experimenter errors, some recordings were
lost, and thus some dates had only one recording.
Transcribers at a professional transcription service
used the two recordings to create a transcript for
each date, and time-stamped the start and end time
of each speaker turn. Transcribers were instructed
to mark various disﬂuencies as well as some nonverbal elements of the conversation such as laughter.
Because of noise, participants who accidentally
turned off their mikes, and some segmentation and
transcription errors, a number of dates were not possible to analyze. 19 dates were lost completely, and
for an additional 130 we lost one of the two audio
tracks and had to use the remaining track to extract
features for both interlocutors. The current study fo-

cuses on the 991 remaining clean dates for which
we had usable audio, transcripts, and survey information.

The Experiments

Our goal is to detect three of the style variables, in
particular awkward, friendly, or ﬂirtatious speakers,
via a machine learning classiﬁer. Recall that each
speaker in a date (each conversation side) was labeled by his or her interlocutor with a rating from
1-10 for awkward, friendly, or ﬂirtatious behavior.
For the experiments, the 1-10 Likert scale ratings
were ﬁrst mean-centered within each respondent so
that the average was 0. Then the top ten percent of
the respondent-centered meaned Likert ratings were
marked as positive for the trait, and the bottom ten
percent were marked as negative for a trait. Thus
each respondent labels the other speaker as either
positive, negative, or NA for each of the three traits.
We run our binary classiﬁcation experiments to
predict this output variable.
For each speaker side of each 4-minute conversation, we extracted features from the waveﬁles and
the transcript, as described in the next section. We
then trained six separate binary classiﬁers (for each
gender for the 3 tasks), as described in Section 5.

Feature Extraction

In selecting features we drew on previous research
on the use of relatively simple surface features that
cue social meaning, described in the next sections.
Each date was represented by the two 4-minute
waveﬁles, one from the recorder worn by each
speaker, and a single transcription. Because of the
very high level of noise, the speaker wearing the
recorder was much clearer on his/her own recording,
and so we extracted the acoustic features for each
speaker from their own microphone (except for the
130 dates for which we only had one audio ﬁle). All
lexical and discourse features were extracted from
the transcripts.
All features describe the speaker of the conversation side being labeled for style. The features for
a conversation side thus indicate whether a speaker
who talks a lot, laughs, is more disﬂuent, has higher
F0, etc., is more or less likely to be considered ﬂirtatious, friendly, or awkward by the interlocutor. We

also computed the same features for the alter interlocutor. Alter features thus indicate the conversational behavior of the speaker talking with an interlocutor they considered to be ﬂirtatious, friendly, or
awkward.
4.1

Prosodic Features

F0 and RMS amplitude features were extracted using Praat scripts (Boersma and Weenink, 2005).
Since the start and end of each turn were timemarked by hand, each feature was easily extracted
over a turn, and then averages and standard deviations were taken over the turns in an entire conversation side. Thus the feature F0 MIN for a conversation
side was computed by taking the F0 min of each turn
in that conversation side (not counting zero values of
F0), and then averaging these values over all turns in
the side. F0 MIN SD is the standard deviation across
turns of this same measure.
Note that we coded four measures of f0 variation, not knowing in advance which one was likely
to be the most useful: F 0 MEAN SD is the deviation
across turns from the global F0 mean for the conversation side, measuring how variable the speakers
mean f0 is across turns. F 0 SD is the standard deviation within a turn for the f0 mean, and then averaged
over turns, hence measures how variable the speakers f0 is within a turn. F 0 SD SD measures how much
the within-turn f0 variance varies from turn to turn,
and hence is another measure of cross-turn f0 variation. PITCH RANGE SD measures how much the
speakers pitch range varies from turn to turn, and
hence is another measure of cross-turn f0 variation.
4.2

Lexical Features

Lexical features have been widely explored in the
psychological and computational literature. For
these features we drew mainly on the LIWC lexicons
of Pennebaker et al. (2007), the standard for social
psychological analysis of lexical features. From the
large variety of lexical categories in LIWC we selected ten that the previous work of Mairesse et al.
(2007) had found to be very signiﬁcant in detecting personality-related features. The 10 LIWC features we used were Anger, Assent, Ingest, Insight,
Negemotion, Sexual, Swear, I, We, and You. We also
added two new lexical features, “past tense auxiliary”, a heuristic for automatically detecting narra-

summarized in Table 2.
4.3

Dialogue Act and Adjacency Pair Features

A number of discourse features were extracted,
drawing from the conversation analysis, disﬂuency
and dialog act literature (Sacks et al., 1974; Jurafsky et al., 1998; Jurafsky, 2001). While discourse
features are clearly important for extracting social
meaning, previous work on social meaning has met
with less success in use of such features (with the
exception of the ‘critical segments’ work of (Enos
et al., 2007)), presumably because discourse fea-

include more words in addition to those shown.

tures are expensive to hand-label and hard to automatically extract. We chose a suggestive discourse
features that we felt might still be automatically extracted.
Four particular dialog acts were chosen as shown
in Table 3. Backchannels (or continuers) and appreciations (a continuer expressing positive affect)
were coded by hand-built regular expressions. The
regular expressions were based on analysis of the
backchannels and appreciations in the hand-labeled
Switchboard corpus of dialog acts (Jurafsky et al.,
1997). Questions were coded simply by the presence of question marks.
Finally, repair questions (also called NTRIs; next
turn repair indicators) are turns in which a speaker
signals lack of hearing or understanding (Schegloff
et al., 1977). To detect these, we used a simple
heuristic: the presence of ‘Excuse me’ or ‘Wait’, as
in the following example:
FEMALE:
MALE:

Okay. Are you excited about that?
Excuse me?

A collaborative completion is a turn where a
speaker completes the utterance begun by the alter
(Lerner, 1991; Lerner, 1996). Our heuristic for identifying collaborative completions was to select sentences for which the ﬁrst word of the speaker was
extremely predictable from the last two words of the
previous speaker. We trained a word trigram model1

interpolated, with Good Turing smoothing, trained on the
Treebank 3 Switchboard transcripts after stripping punctuation.

and used it to compute the probability p of the ﬁrst
word of a speaker’s turn given the last two words
of the interlocutor’s turn. We arbitrarily chose the
threshold .01, labeling all turns for which p > .01 as
collaborative completions and used the total number
of collaborative completions in a conversation side
as our variable. This simple heuristic was errorful,
but did tend to ﬁnd completions beginning with and
or or (1 below) and wh-questions followed by an NP
or PP phrase that is grammatically coherent with the
end of the question (2 and 3):
(1) FEMALE:
(1) MALE:

The driving range.
And the tennis court, too.

(2) MALE:
(2) FEMALE:

What year did you graduate?
From high school?

(3) FEMALE:
(3) MALE:

What department are you in?
The business school.

We also marked aspects of the preference structure of language. A dispreferred action is one in
which a speaker avoids the face-threat to the interlocutor that would be caused by, e.g., refusing a
request or not answering a question, by using speciﬁc strategies such as the use of well, hesitations, or
restarts (Schegloff et al., 1977; Pomerantz, 1984).
Finally, we included the number of instances of
laughter for the side, as well as the total number of
turns a speaker took.

Classiﬁer Training

Before performing the classiﬁcation task, we preprocessed the data in two ways. First, we standardized
all the variables to have zero mean and unit variance.
We did this to avoid imposing a prior on any of the
features based on their numerical values.2 Second,

Consider a feature A with mean 100 and a feature B with
mean .1 where A and B are correlated with the output. Since
regularization favors small weights there is a bias to put weight
on feature A because intuitively the weight on feature B would

we removed features correlated greater than .7. One
goal of removing correlated features was to remove
as much colinearity as possible from the regression
so that the regression weights could be ranked for
their importance in the classiﬁcation. In addition,
we hoped to improve classiﬁcation because a large
number of features require more training examples
(Ng, 2004). For example for male ﬂirt we removed
f0 range (highly correlated with f0 max), f0 min sd
(highly correlated with f0 min), and Swear (highly
correlated with Anger).
For each classiﬁcation task due to the small
amounts of data we performed k-fold cross validation to learn and evaluate our models. We used
a variant of k-fold cross validation with ﬁve folds
where three folds are used for training, one fold is
used for validation, and one fold is used as a test set.
This test fold is not used in any training step. This
yields a datasplit of 60% for training, 20% for validation, and 20% for testing, or 120 training examples, 40 validation examples, and 40 test examples.
To ensure that we were not learning something speciﬁc to our data split, we randomized our data ordering and repeated the k-fold cross validation variant
25 times.
We used regularized logistic regression for classiﬁcation. Recall that in logistic regression we train
a vector of feature weights θ ∈ Rn so as to make
the following classiﬁcation of some output variable
y for an input observation x:3
p(y|x; θ) =

1
1 + exp(−θT x)

In regularized logistic regression we ﬁnd the
need to be 1000 times larger to carry the same effect. This argument holds similarly for the reduction to unit variance.

We chose L1 -regularization because the number of
training examples to learn well grows logarithmically with the number of input variables (Ng, 2004),
and to achieve a sparse activation of our features
to ﬁnd only the most salient explanatory variables.
This choice of regularization was made to avoid the
problems that often plague supervised learning in
situations with large number of features but only a
small number of examples. The search space over
the sparsity parameter α is bounded around an expected sparsity to prevent overﬁtting.
Finally, to evaluate our model on the learned α
and θα we used the features X of the test set Stest to
compute the predicted outputs Y using the logistic
regression model. Accuracy is simply computed as
the percent of correct predictions.
To avoid any data ordering bias, we calculated
a θα for each randomized run. The output of the
runs was a vector of weights for each feature. We
kept any feature if the median of its weight vector
was nonzero.4 A sample boxplot for the highest
weighted ego features for predicting male ﬂirt can
be found in Figure 1.

We also performed a t-test to ﬁnd salient feature values
signiﬁcantly different than zero; the non-zero median method
turned out to be a more conservative measure in practice (intuitively, because L1 normed regression pushes weights to 0).

Table 5: Accuracy of binary classiﬁcation of each conversation side, where chance is 50%. The ﬁrst row uses
features only from the single speaker; the second adds all
the features from the interlocutor as well. These accuracy results were aggregated from 25 randomized runs of
5-fold cross validation.

The ﬁrst row shows results using features extracted from the speaker being labeled. Here, all
conversational styles are easiest to detect in men.
The second row of table 5 shows the accuracy
when using features from both speakers. Not surprisingly, adding information about the interlocutor
tends to improve classiﬁcation, and especially for
women, suggesting that male speaking has greater
sway over perceptions of conversational style. We
discuss below the role of these features.
We ﬁrst considered the features that helped classiﬁcation when considering only the ego (i.e., the results in the ﬁrst row of Table 5). Table 6 shows feature weights for the features (features were normed
so weights are comparable), and is summarized in

Table 6: Feature weights (median weights of the randomized runs) for the non-zero predictors for each classiﬁer.
Since our accuracy for detecting awkwardness in women
based solely on ego features is so close to chance, we
didn’t analyze the awkwardness features for women here.

laborative completions, laugh, overlap, but don’t
backchannel or use appreciations. Their utterances
are shorter (in seconds and words) and they are quieter and their (minimum) pitch is lower and somewhat less variable.
• Women labeled as friendly have more collaborative completions, repair questions, laughter, and
appreciations. They use more words overall, and use
I more often. They are more disﬂuent (both restarts
and uh) but less likely to swear. Prosodically their f0
is higher, and there seems to be some pattern involving quiet speech; more variation in intensity minimum than intensity max.
• Men who are labeled as ﬂirting ask more questions, including repair questions, and use you. They
don’t use backchannels or appreciations, or overlap
as much. They laugh more, and use more sexual and
negative emotional words. Prosodically they speak
faster, with higher and more variable pitch, but quieter (lower intensity max).
• The strongest features for women who are labeled as ﬂirting are prosodic; they speak faster and
louder with higher and more variable pitch. They
also use more words in general, swear more, don’t
ask questions or use Assent, use more I, laugh more,
and are somewhat more disﬂuent (restarts).
• Men who are labeled as awkward are more disﬂuent, with increased restarts and ﬁlled pauses (uh
and um). They are also not ‘collaborative’ conversationalists; they don’t use appreciations, repair questions, collaborative completions, past-tense, or you,
take fewer turns overall, and don’t overlap. Prosodically the awkward labels are hard to characterize;
there is both an increase in pitch variation (f0 sd sd)
and a decrease (f0 mean sd). They don’t seem to get
quite as loud (intensity max).
The previous analysis showed what features of the
ego help in classiﬁcation. We next asked about features of the alter, based on the results using both
ego and alter features in the second row of Table 5.
Here we are asking about the linguistic behaviors of
a speaker who describes the interlocutor as ﬂirting,
friendly, or awkward.
While we don’t show these values in a table, we
offer here an overview of their tendencies. For
example for women who labeled their male interlocutors as friendly, the women got much quieter, used ‘well’ much more, laughed, asked more

repair questions, used collaborative completions,
and backchanneled more. When a man labeled a
woman as friendly, he used an expanded intensity
range (quieter intensity min, louder intensity max).
laughed more, used more sexual terms, used less
negative emotional terms, and overlapped more.
When women labeled their male interlocutor as
ﬂirting, the women used many more repair questions, laughed more, and got quieter (lower intensity
min). By contrast, when a man said his female interlocutor was ﬂirting, he used more Insight and Anger
words, and raised his pitch.
When women labeled their male interlocutor as
awkward, the women asked a lot of questions, used
well, were disﬂuent (restarts), had a diminished
pitch range, and didn’t use I. In listening to some
of these conversations, it was clear that the conversation lagged repeatedly, and the women used questions at these points to restart the conversations.

Discussion

The results presented here should be regarded with
some caution. The sample is not a random sample of
English speakers or American adults, and speed dating is not a natural context for expressing every conversational style. Therefore, a wider array of studies
across populations and genres would be required before a more general theory of conversational styles is
established.
On the other hand, the presented results may
under-reﬂect the relations being captured. The quality of recordings and coarse granularity (1 second)
of the time-stamps likely cloud the relations, and as
the data is cleaned and improved, we expect the associations to only grow stronger.
Caveats aside, we believe the evidence indicates
that the perception of several types of conversational
style have relatively clear signals across genders, but
with some additional gender contextualization.
Both genders convey ﬂirtation by laughing more,
speaking faster, and using higher and more variable
pitch. Both genders convey friendliness by laughing
more, and using collaborative completions.
However, we do ﬁnd gender differences; men asl
more questions when (labeled as) ﬂirting, women
ask fewer. Men labeled as ﬂirting are softer, but
women labeled as ﬂirting are louder. Women ﬂirt-

ing swear more, while men are more likely to use
sexual vocabulary. Gender differences exist as well
for the other variables. Men labeled as friendly use
you while women labeled as friendly use I. Friendly
women are very disﬂuent; friendly men are not.
While the features for friendly and ﬂirtatious
speech overlap, there are clear differences. Men
speaker faster and with higher f0 (min) in ﬂirtatious
speech, but not faster and with lower f0 (min) in
friendly speech. For men, ﬂirtatious speech involves
more questions and repair questions, while friendly
speech does not. For women, friendly speech is
more disﬂuent than ﬂirtatious speech, and has more
collaborative style (completions, repair questions,
appreciations).
We also seem to see a model of collaborative conversational style (probably related to the collaborative ﬂoor of Edelsky (1981) and Coates (1996)),
cued by the use of more collaborative completions,
repair questions and other questions, you, and laughter. These collaborative techniques were used by
both women and men who were labeled as friendly,
and occurred less with men labeled as awkward.
Women themselves displayed more of this collaborative conversational style when they labeled the
men as friendly. For women only, collaborative style
included appreciations; while for men only, collaborative style included overlaps.
In addition to these implications for social science, our work has implications for the extraction of
meaning in general. A key focus of our work was on
ways to extract useful dialog act and disﬂuency features (repair questions, backchannels, appreciations,
restarts, dispreferreds) with very shallow methods.
These features were indeed extractable and proved
to be useful features in classiﬁcation.
We are currently extending these results to predict
date outcomes including ‘liking’, extending work
such as Madan and Pentland (2006).
