This study investigates three factors that have been argued to define "canonical form" in sentence
comprehension: syntactic structure, semantic role, and frequency of usage. We first examine the claim that
sentences containing unaccusative verbs present difficulties analogous to those of passive sentences. Using
a plausibility judgment task, we show that a mixed group of aphasics performed significantly better on
unaccusatives than on passives. We then turn to the observation that passives are generally harder than
actives for aphasics. We show that this effect is modulated by lexical bias, i.e. the likelihood that a verb
appears in a given syntactic structure: Passives of passive-bias verbs are significantly easier than passives
of active-bias verbs. More generally, sentences whose structure matches the lexical bias of the main verb
are significantly easier than sentences in which structure and lexical bias do not match. These findings
suggest that "canonical form" reflects frequency and lexical biases.

Introduction
The simplicity of "canonical form", or "canonical word order", for normal and aphasic comprehension has
often been taken as self-evident in the sentence comprehension literature. However, as has been pointed out
by Menn (2000), the privileged status of canonical form itself needs explanation. Different definitions of
"canonical form" yield testably different predictions. One approach to the definition of canonical sentence
form is that implicit in Bates et al. (1987, inter alii). Bates et al. note that sentences with Agent-ActionObject order represent the canonical word order for English. A second approach is based on syntactic
"movement" analyses and defines as non-canonical any word order that diverges from the [IPNP-[VPVerbNP]] configuration assumed for the deep structure of English sentences. Based on this understanding of
canonicity, Kegl (1995) argues that sentences with unaccusative verbs should be difficult to process for
aphasic patients, in particular for patients with "agrammatism", for reasons that are analogous to the factors
giving rise to the greater difficulty of passives compared to actives. Although the precise definition of
unaccusativity is contested (see e.g. Levin and Rappaport Hovav 1995), unaccusative verbs are generally
understood to be intransitive verbs whose (surface) subjects represent Undergoer arguments. Examples of
unaccusative verbs include verbs like melt and blush. Under the transformational analysis assumed in Kegl
(1995), the surface subjects of unaccusative verbs are linked via movement to direct objects in deep
structure. Unaccusatives therefore induce the very same difficulties as passive sentences, according to
Kegl's analysis, and should be as hard as passives for aphasic speakers.
A different approach to canonical form has been proposed by Menn et al. (1998) who suggest that
canonical form relies on the most frequent syntactic frame for a given verb. Under this view, aphasic
problems with producing and understanding passives derive from the fact that, for most transitive verbs,
passives occur less frequently than actives. One prediction of this approach, also advanced by Gahl (2000),
is that comprehension difficulty should vary with the lexical bias of the words in a given sentence, i.e. with
the likelihood of a particular word's occurring in a particular type of syntactic frame. For example, active
transitive sentences should not be uniformly easy to process. Rather, verbs that are rarely transitive should
induce greater comprehension difficulty than verbs that are frequently transitive.

As argued in Menn (2000), the basic assumptions underlying the definition of canonical form have not been
seriously tested. Furthermore, most experimental work to date relies on materials in which syntax,
semantics, and frequency of usage are confounded: The contrast between actives and passives, for example,
has been tested primarily with highly transitive verbs like kick and break. These verbs are most often used
in the active form, so the greater difficulty of their passive counterparts could be due to syntactic, semantic,
or frequency factors.
To tease apart the effects of frequency of usage, syntactic structure, and semantic roles, the present paper
investigates aphasic comprehension of four types of sentences. In two of the sentence types tested - active
transitive, and intransitive with agentive subjects -, the Agent precedes the Undergoer. In the other two
sentence types - passive, and intransitive with Undergoer subjects (roughly, unaccusatives) - the Undergoer
precedes the Agent. For each of the four types of sentences or syntactic frames, we test verbs that occur
frequently in the given frame and verbs that occur infrequently in the frame in question. We are particularly
interested in the extent to which matches or mismatches between lexical bias and syntactic structure may be
responsible for the observed difficulty of passives, and of unaccusatives compared to passives on the one
hand, and to intransitive verbs with agentive subjects on the other.
Materials and Methods
To explore the role of lexical bias in sentence comprehension, we tested four types of syntactic frames:
active transitive (T), passive (P), intransitive-undergoer subject (IU; roughly, unaccusative) and
intransitive-agentive subject (IA). The method used was judging the plausibility of sentences using verbs
with different preferred syntactic frames. We needed several verbs favoring each of the four syntactic
frames. As part of a related project reported in Roland et al. (2000), we determined the preferred frames of
about 80 verbs from the British National Corpus. This was done by hand-classifying 100 randomly-chosen
occurrences of each verb by syntactic frame. Not every verb appeared in all four frames, since not all
English verbs alternate between transitive and intransitive forms. We identified those verbs which appeared
in at least two of the four frames and showed over 50% preference for one of the four frames. These verbs
were considered to have a lexical bias for that frame. About 150 plausible 3-NP sentences were created by
combining each verb with one or two noun phrases and at least one prepositional phrase; all of these
sentences were ‘real-world’ irreversible in the sense that interchanging the NPs would result in an
implausible sentence. We used each verb in all the frames for which grammatical sentences could be
created; a few verbs could be used in all four frames, but most were usable in only two or three. For
example, for the verb slip, our sentences included The thief slipped the jewelry into the pocket and The
jewelry slipped out of the thief's pocket. An equal number of implausible sentences was created from the
same verbs and NPs (with minor modifications in functors, where needed, to avoid having such locally
implausible sub-sequences as ‘in the table’), e. g. The jewelry slipped the thief into the pocket.
A written list of the full set of plausible and implausible sentences was presented in two pseudo-random
orders to a pool of undergraduate normal subjects for rating on a scale of 1 to 7; the 149 sentences with
extreme ratings (average above 5.6 or below 2.3) – about half of the original set - were then presented to
subjects with aphasia for their judgments. There were thirty-two combinations of the four syntactic frames,
the verb biases to each of the four frames, and the two levels of plausibility (plausible and implausible).
However, seven of the thirty-two cells were empty after the sentences with equivocal plausibility ratings
were removed. This necessarily limited the statistical analyses that could be performed.
Each subject with aphasia then individually heard the list of sentences in the same pseudo-random order
and was asked to say if each sentence made sense or not. Each sentence was read aloud, and repeated upon
request. Actual yes-no responses were written down and later evaluated as correct or incorrect. Two
subjects who made too few errors for analysis and one subject who said that all but 5 of the sentences were
plausible were excluded from analysis. The remaining eight subjects provide the data analyzed below.
Subjects
The subjects were eight aphasic patients. Testing took place at the University of Arizona and the University
of Colorado, Boulder. Background information on the eight aphasic patients is given in Table 2 below.

Results
Analysis of group data
The three questions posed in this study are (1) whether sentences with unaccusative verbs and passive
sentences indeed present similar difficulties as predicted by Kegl (1995), (2) whether sentences with
Undergoer subjects are generally more difficult than sentences with agentive subjects, and (3) whether
comprehension difficulty is influenced by the match or mismatch between syntactic structure and the
lexical bias of the verb, as predicted by Menn (2000) and Gahl (2000).
If, as postulated by Kegl (1995), aphasic patients experience difficulties with sentences containing
unaccusative verbs that are analogous to those encountered with passives, then these patients should
perform equally poorly on the two sentence types. That this is not the case can be seen from Table 1, which
presents the total number of correct and incorrect responses from the group of eight aphasic subjects in
each condition. A chi-square analysis shows that performance on intransitive-undergoer subject (IU)
sentences was significantly better than on passive (P) sentences (χ2 (187,320) = 21.398, p < 0.00001). (In
this and all other comparisons, the degrees of freedom for the chi-square tests were one, and the number of
trials entering each comparison is presented in parentheses). It might be objected that this finding could
simply be due to the fact that intransitive sentences contain only one syntactic argument, whereas passives
contain two. To rule out this possibility, we compared performance on IU and intransitive-agentive subject
(IA) sentences: If the movement account of unaccusatives is correct, then intransitive sentences with
unaccusative verbs should be harder than intransitive sentences with agentive subjects, i.e. sentences that
are not subject to any movement operation. That this is not the case can again be seen from a chi-square test
comparing the error rates on IU and IA sentences, which are virtually identical (χ2 (187, 181) = 0.158, p =
0.691, n.s.). The fact that performance on intransitive-agent (IA) and intransitive-undergoer (IU) sentences
did not differ significantly also fails to support the claim that Undergoer-first sentences should necessarily
be more difficult for aphasic patients than Agent-first sentences, as predicted by an approach to canonical
form purely based on semantic roles. This answers the second of our three questions.
To check whether the plausibility judgment task is in fact capable of detecting relevant differences in
processing difficulty, we also compared patients' performance on active transitive sentences and passives.
As was to be expected, active transitive sentences in fact elicited significantly better performance than
passives (χ2 (510, 320) = 23.615, p < 0.00001).

Table 1: Total number of correct and incorrect responses from eight aphasic subjects on the plausibility
judgment task. The first number in each cell shows the number of correct or incorrect responses on
plausible stimuli. The second number (in parentheses) shows the number of correct or incorrect responses
on implausible sentences. Highlighted cells represent "concordant" conditions, i.e. ones in which sentence
frame and verb bias match.
Turning to our third question, concerning the effect of match between lexical bias and syntactic frame, we
find that performance on "matching" (concordant) sentences was significantly better than on nonmatching
sentences: (χ2 (528, 670) = 13.421, p < 0.001). This suggests that comprehension difficulty is indeed
influenced by match between lexical bias and syntactic structure.
Analysis of data from individual subjects
As is usually the case with data from aphasic patients, there is a considerable amount of between-subject
variability. In Table 2 below, we show the results for each individual patient. Several of our subjects
showed a tendency towards accepting all sentences as plausible. What is needed is a statistical measure that
takes this type of response bias into account in assessing subjects' sensitivity to sentence plausibility.
Therefore, in the analysis of individual patients' responses, we adopt the logic and notation of signal
detection analysis. Specifically, we use A', a non-parametric index of sensitivity, (Pollack & Norman 1964,
Grier 1971), for this purpose.1 The values of A' range from 0 to 1. A value of 0.5 indicates complete
inability to discriminate between two types of events (in our case, plausible and implausible sentences). A
value of 1 indicates perfect discrimination of the two types of events. In determining the values for A', we
made use of the formula reported in Grier (1971).

1

Another commonly used statistic for this type of task is d', which we rejected because of the assumptions
it requires about the probability distributions underlying subjects' performance (cf. Swets 1973).

For each combination of sentence type and lexical bias, we compare the proportion of plausible sentences
which the subject correctly accepts as plausible to the proportion of implausible sentences which the
subject falsely accepts. Note that the value of A' is undefined when a subject accepts all stimuli in a set (in
our case, when a subject accepts all sentences in a particular condition as plausible).
Two important features of the data can be gleaned from Table 2. First, there is clear evidence of good
discrimination ability in all eight subjects, i.e. plausible sentences elicit different responses from
implausible ones. Second, the data from individual subjects tend to be consistent with the findings based on
pooled group data. Specifically, performance on passive sentences is worse than on intransitive-undergoer
subject (IU) sentences. In addition, "concordant" sentences, i.e. sentences whose structure matches the bias
of the main verb, tend to elicit better performance than "discordant" sentences, i.e. ones in which there is a
mismatch between syntactic structure and lexical bias.

General Discussion
The three questions posed in this study were whether sentences with unaccusative verbs and passive
sentences indeed present similar difficulties, whether sentences with Undergoer subjects are generally more
difficult than sentences with agentive subjects, and whether comprehension difficulty was influenced by the
match or mismatch between syntactic structure and the lexical bias of the verb. We discuss these three
questions in turn.

Kegl (1995) found that story narratives by several agrammatic speakers contained fewer unaccusatives
than similar narratives by normal speakers. Since unaccusatives are transformationally derived in the
syntactic framework assumed in Kegl (1995) (and other transformational theories), Kegl hypothesized that
agrammatic aphasics should have problems with unaccusatives that paralleled their difficulties with
passives, and interpreted the near-absence of unaccusative verbs in their narratives as confirming this
hypothesis. We found that performance on unaccusatives was significantly better than performance on
passives, and that performance on unaccusatives was not significantly different from performance on
intransitive sentences with agentive subjects. These findings constitute a challenge for Kegl's account, and
more generally for purely syntactic approaches to explaining patterns of aphasic miscomprehension.
Similarly, Gottfried et al. (1997) showed that aphasic speakers had equal difficulty in repeating sentences
whose subjects were Agents and sentences whose subjects were Undergoers, again challenging the claim
that the derivation of unaccusatives poses particular problems for aphasics.
It might be objected that Kegl's claim pertained specifically to agrammatic patients with Broca's aphasia,
and that our data from a mixed patient group therefore do not constitute a direct challenge. Indeed, it is
theoretically possible that agrammatic patients with Broca's aphasia have difficulties with unaccusatives
and passives for reasons that do not apply to other patient groups. However, we do not think that the
comprehension patterns that have been observed for aphasic patients in general offer sufficient motivation
for setting "agrammatic" patients with Broca's aphasia apart from all other patients (see e.g. Goodglass &
Menn 1985, Berndt et al. 1996).
An alternative explanation for the near-absence of unaccusative verbs in Kegl's data suggests itself: In
general, narratives from speakers with aphasia encode considerably less information than those from
unimpaired speakers. At the same time, aphasic speakers do have an accurate sense of what the key
elements of a story are; thus, these speakers tend to encode the main line of action in a story, leaving out
the background and less important items (Menn et al. 1998, 1999). For most stories, this entails reporting
the actions of a small set of agonists, which tend to get encoded as agentive subjects or, in the case of
Undergoers, as objects. Hence, we would expect verbs with Undergoer subjects to be proportionately less
frequent in aphasic narratives, unless the plot has been chosen to highlight events that are not under the
protagonist’s control.
With regard to our second question, while our approach has much in common with the semantic-role based
account of canonical form, our findings do not support the hypothesis that sentences with undergoer
subjects are uniformly more difficult than sentences with agentive subjects. Semantic roles are indeed
important predictors of sentence comprehension difficulty, as long as lexical bias is also taken into account.
With regard to our third question, we found that performance on "matching" (concordant) sentences was
significantly better than on nonmatching sentences. We conclude from this that syntactic structure alone
does not adequately account for comprehension difficulty: the match between syntactic structure and verb
bias needs to be taken into account. Our findings confirm those of Gahl (2000). This earlier study tested
three sentence types (active transitive, passive, and intransitive-undergoer subject), with similar results as
the present study. Thus, the results of the present study add to a growing body of evidence that aphasic
sentence comprehension reflects usage-based and exposure-based factors also known to influence normal
comprehension. In the future, we plan to examine the effect of lexical bias in aphasic patients' speech, using
elicited speech. We believe that, despite the care taken in this study to include only 'natural-sounding'
sentences in the experiment, patients' speech affords a look at more natural data.
As stated earlier, the notion of 'canonical form' has variously been defined in purely syntactic or purely
semantic terms. Kegl (1995) is consistent with a purely syntactic approach to defining canonical form,
whereas the work of Bates et al. (1987) represents an approach to canonical form that is based on semantic
roles. Our findings support an alternative approach to the definition of canonical word order, one that takes
syntactic, semantic, and frequency-based factors into account.
