ABSTRACT
What features are helpful for Chinese question detection?
Which of them are more important? What are the
differences between Chinese and English regarding
feature importance? We study these questions by building
question detectors for Chinese and English conversational
speech, and performing analytic studies and feature
selection experiments. As in English, we find that both
textual and prosodic features are helpful for Chinese
question detection. Among textual features, word
identities, especially the utterance-final word, are more
useful than the global (N-gram) sentence likelihood.
Unlike in English, where final pitch rise is a good cue for
questions, we find in Chinese that utterance final pitch
behavior is not a good feature. Instead, the most useful
prosodic feature is the spectral balance, i.e., the
distribution of energy over the frequency spectrum, of the
final syllable. We also find effects of tone, e.g., that
treating interjection words as having a special tone is
helpful. Our final classifier achieves an error rate of
14.9% with respect to a 50% chance-level rate.

1. INTRODUCTION
Identification of dialogue acts (DAs), such as statements,
questions, backchannels, and so on, is of fundamental
importance to automatic understanding of natural speech.
In this study, we investigate automatic question detection,
a particular task of DA identification, in conversational
Mandarin Chinese speech.
Both word-based and acoustic-prosodic information
have been used for English DA identification. There have
been two approaches to using word-based information: Ngram language models and Word Identity. In the N-gram
approach [1,2,3], the transcripts of the training corpus are
grouped by DA type, and an N-gram LM is trained for
each DA type. The LMs are used to compute a likelihood
of the entire word sequence for each DA type, and the DA
whose LM assigns the maximum likelihood is chosen. In
the Word Identity approach [3,4,5], particular words are
extracted and used as features in classification, for
example, the first and last word of an utterance, cue words

and phrases [6]. A performance comparison of the two
approaches has not been reported in the literature.
Although words are the primary cue for DA
identification, acoustic-prosodic information is also
helpful [1,7]. Furthermore, there are motivations for
investigating DA identification from prosodic cues alone
[1,8], such as the high error rate of conversational
recognizers and the fact that e.g., some questions have the
same word order as statements (e.g., “tomorrow?”, “He is
a student?”), and hence can only be identified via
prosody. Prosodic features based on pitch, energy, and
duration have been used by a number of labs for DA
identification, and the relative importance of the features
discussed, for example in [1].
Chinese is very different from English and other IndoEuropean languages, which most DA identification
studies focused on. First, while English questions often
have ‘inverted’ word order from statements, Chinese
questions have the same word order as statements. The
particle ‘吗 (ma)’ can be added to any statement and
convert it into a yes-no question. There is also a special
type of question called the A-not-A question [9], which is
formed with the main verb followed by negation ‘不 (bu)’
or ‘没 (mei)’ and the reduplicated verb. Listed below are
examples of common types of questions in Mandarin
Chinese:
Statement:

他
想
去.
he want go
“He wants to go.”

Yes-no question:

他
想
去
吗?
he want go ma
“Does he want to go?”

Echo question:

他
想
去?
he want go
“He wants to go?”

A-not-A question: 他
想
不
想
去?
He want not want go
“Does he want to go or not?”
Wh-question:

他
为什么
想
去?
he
why
want go
“Why does he want to go?”

We hypothesize that cues to Chinese questions may be
extremely local, and hence that specific word identities
may function better than the total sentence likelihood
assigned by the N-gram model. Furthermore, since
question markers are at the end of sentences, sentencefinal words should be more helpful than sentence-initial
words in Chinese question detection. We’ll test these
hypotheses and compare the results with English.
Second, Chinese is a tonal language. The difference
between question and statement intonation in Chinese is
complicated because of the interaction of tone and
intonation. For example, interrogative intonation on a
final word with a rising tone has a rising end, resembling
the final rise in English, whereas question intonation on a
final word with a falling tone often has a falling end (as
shown in the last 100 ms of Figure 1).

contain more than one dialogue act, we extracted and used
only the last part of each selected turn, that is, from where
the second to the end punctuation is, or from the
beginning if there is only an ending punctuation, to the
end of the turn. The data sample was tagged as a
statement if ending with a period and a question if ending
with a question mark.
There were more statements (75.4%) than questions
(24.6%) in the data. To avoid the imbalanced data
problem, we downsampled the statements to obtain an
equal number of statements and questions, following [1].
Our training set contained 3085 statements and 3085
questions, and dev set contains 642 statements and 642
questions. The training and dev sets were partitioned in
the CALLHOME corpus. They shared no speakers. Below
are some examples taken from the training set:

Vertical lines mark syllable boundaries. Numbers indicate tones.

Perceptual studies have shown that the final tones affect
intonation perception. Question intonation, for example, is
easier to recognize by a human if the sentence-final tone
is falling whereas it is harder to recognize if the sentencefinal tone is rising [10]. How, then, do tones affect
automatic question detection? What prosodic features are
more useful? What is the difference between Chinese and
English on the importance of particular prosodic features?
We did experiments to answer these questions.
The paper is organized as follows: in the next section
we present the data used for our experiments. In section 3,
we discuss the features useful for question detection in
Chinese and their relative importance. In section 4, we
report the results of our evaluation. In section 5, we
compare the difference between Chinese and English on
feature importance. Finally, we present our conclusions.
2. DATA
Our data were taken from the CALLHOME Mandarin
Chinese corpus of telephone speech (LDC96S24) and its
transcripts (LDC96T16). The transcripts are timestamped
by speaker turn. We selected all the speaker turns that
conclude with either a period or a question mark in the
transcripts. These turns were then word aligned using the
SONIC speech recognition system [11], with an acoustic
model trained on the CALLHOME and CALLFRIEND
(LDC96S55) Mandarin Chinese corpora. Since a turn may

3. FEATURES
In this section, we study the roles of textual features,
prosodic features, and tones in question detection. All
experiments were run using the decision tree classifier
C4.5 [12] and doing 5-fold cross validation on the training
set. The add-one-in technique was used for doing feature
selection.
3.1. Textual features
To compare the performance of the N-gram language
model approach and the Word Identity approach, and to
find if the classifier can be improved by combining the
two approaches, we calculated the difference between the
log-likelihoods of a sentence (a word sequence) being a
question and being a statement, and used it as a textual
feature of the sentence. The other textual features
included word identities, including the first and last word
of the sentence, the number of words in the sentence,
whether there is a Wh-word, A-not-A construction,
negation, and the word ‘you’ or ‘your’ in the sentence.
Table 1. Textual features selected by add-one-in.

We did feature selection on these features. The results
are listed in Table 1. We can see that the N-gram sentence
probability feature was not selected; and the error rate of
using the N-gram sentence probability feature (21.7%)
was about 5% (absolute) higher than that of using the
selected feature vector (16.9%). From these results we
conclude that word identities are more useful than the
global (N-gram) sentence likelihood for Chinese question
detection. The last word was the first selected feature
whereas the first word was excluded, showing that as a
textual feature the sentence-final word is more useful than
the sentence-initial word.
3.2. Prosodic features
3.2.1. Normalization
Speech prosody manifests itself in pitch, energy, and
duration. There is significant variation among speakers in
these acoustic measures. To normalize prosodic features
by speakers, we first located the maximum and minimum
pitch, energy, and syllable duration of each speaker, after
exclusion of the speaker’s highest and lowest 2% data to
eliminate measurement and alignment errors; then we
normalized the raw data by setting the maximum as 10
and the minimum as 0, as shown in the equation:

XNorm = ( XRaw − Min) ×

10
( Max − Min)

The raw F0 data (in Hz) were logarithmized before
normalization. The raw energy (in dB) and duration (in
second) data were directly used for normalization.
3.2.2. Pitch features
Many previous studies point to the importance of the
utterance-final region to the realization of question
intonation. The utterance final behavior of question
intonation has been interpreted differently in Chinese
intonation models, including via boundary tone [13],
prosodic strength [14], baseline and topline [15]. Guided
by these models, we extracted four pitch features from the
utterance final syllable: the highest pitch over the final
syllable, the lowest pitch over the final syllable, the pitch
range of the final syllable, and the pitch at the end of the
final syllable.
Besides utterance final behavior, previous studies also
found that question intonation has an effect on the pitch of
the whole utterance [14,16,17]. To capture this effect, we
fitted a linear regression line to the pitch curve of each
utterance, and used the slope and the intercept of the fitted
line as two more pitch features, encoding the direction and
the height of the pitch curve.

3.2.3. Energy features
Compared to pitch, energy has drawn much less attention
in the literature of dialogue act realization. Tsao claimed
that question intonation in Chinese is ‘a matter of stress’
[18]. There are also quantitative studies showing that in
laboratory speech the overall intensity of sentence final
syllables is greater in questions than in statements [19].
On the other hand, the role of energy in accent and
stress realization has been extensively studied. Many
studies show that spectral balance (or spectral emphasis,
spectral tilt), measuring the distribution of energy over the
frequency spectrum, is a more reliable acoustic cue of
accent and stress than the overall intensity [20]. Spectral
balance has also been used as a feature in pitch accent
detection [21,22] and disfluency identification [23], and
proved more useful than the overall intensity in pitch
accent detection [21].
To study the role of spectral balance in question
detection and to compare it with overall intensity, we did
feature selection on the following energy features, which
were extracted over the last syllable:
Int_overall: the overall intensity;
Int_0_05: the intensity in the frequency band of 0-0.5 kHz;
Int_05_1: the intensity in the frequency band of 0.5-1 kHz;
Int_1_2: the intensity in the frequency band of 1-2 kHz;
Int_2_4: the intensity in the frequency band of 2-4 kHz;
Int_balance: the difference between Int_1_2 and Int_0_05.

The results are listed in Table 2.
Table 2. Energy features selected by add-one-in.

Feature added
Int_balance
+ Int_05_1
+ Int_2_4

Error rate
36.0%
35.9%
35.7%

Spectral balance was first selected whereas the overall
intensity was excluded from the final feature set, showing
that, as in English accent detection, spectral balance is
more useful than the overall intensity in Chinese question
detection. The intensity over 0.5 to 1 kHz and over 2 to 4
kHz were also selected, although they only contributed to
a small error rate reduction (0.3%).
3.2.4. Duration features
The duration difference between statement and question
intonation in Chinese has been studied in [19]. In general,
the utterance final syllable in question intonation tends to
be longer than in statement intonation; whereas the other
syllables in question intonation tend to be shorter.
Therefore, we extracted three duration features: the
duration of the final syllable, the average duration of the
other syllables, and the length of the whole utterance (the
last feature was not normalized).

3.2.5. Feature selection
We’ve introduced three groups of prosodic features.
They are listed in Table 3.
Table 3. Prosodic features.

Pitch
features

Energy

features

Slope: the slope of the fitted line;
Intercept: the intercept of the fitted line;
Max: the highest pitch over the last syllable;
Min: the lowest pitch over the last syllable;
Range: the pitch range of the last syllable;
End: the pitch at the end of the final syllable;
Int_balance: Int_1_2 minus Int_0_05;
Int_05_1: the intensity over 0.5-1 kHz;
Int_2_4: the intensity over 2-4 kHz;
Last: the duration of the final syllable;
Pre: the average duration of the previous
syllables (other than the last syllable);
Length: the length of the whole utterance;

excluding the final tone from the prosodic feature vector.
This result shows that tonal information is helpful in
Chinese question detection.
There are a great number of utterances in our data, both
statements and questions, containing only an interjection
word. In Chinese dictionaries, the interjection words
usually have more than one tone. For example, in the
Modern Chinese Dictionary, ‘哦 (oh)’ is listed with two
tones, tone2 (a rising tone), indicating ‘not totally believe
something’ and tone4 (a falling tone), indicating ‘got it’.
Obviously, the intonation forms on the interjection word
were interpreted as its tones. Figure 2 draws the
(normalized) pitch curves of the interjection words
appeared in a one-word statement or question (randomly
selected 300 statements and questions were drawn).

To explore their relative importance, we did feature
selection on the prosodic features. The results are listed in
Table 4.
Table 4. Prosodic features selected by add-one-in.

Feature added
Int_balance (energy)
+Length (duration)
+Slope (pitch)
+Last (duration)
+Intercept (pitch)

Error rate
36.0%
34.0%
31.9%
30.6%
30.5%

Used in isolation, the spectral balance of the final
syllable is the most useful prosodic feature. None of the
utterance-final pitch features, on the other hand, were
selected by add-one-in. This result suggests that at the
utterance-final position energy is more reliable than pitch
as a prosodic cue of question intonation in Chinese.
Whether boundary tone or prosodic strength better
explains question intonation in Chinese is an open
problem. Our result favors prosodic strength over
boundary tone.
The two global pitch features, representing the direction
and the height of the overall pitch curve, and two duration
features, the length of the utterance and the duration of the
last syllable, were also selected, which is consistent with
phonetic studies of Chinese intonation.
3.3. Tones
There are four citation tones and a neutral tone in
Mandarin Chinese, referred to as Tone1, Tone2, Tone3,
Tone4, and Tone0. We found that the classification error
rate was up about 4%, from 30.5% to 34.3% when

Figure 2: The (normalized) pitch curves of interjections in
statements (shown on the top) and questions (shown on the
bottom).

The interjections have a falling pitch curve in
statements and a rising pitch curve in questions,
suggesting that they are toneless. We may either treat the
interjections as having a neutral tone, or as having a
different tone, which we could call Tone5. From Table 5,
we can see that treating the interjections as a special tone
slightly improve the performance of the prosodic features.

4. EVALUATION
We discussed above the textual and prosodic features
useful for Chinese question detection, and their relative
importance. In this section, we evaluate these features on
the withheld dev set. The results are listed in Table 6.

The results shown in Table 6 are consistent with what
we have found in the previous section. First, word
identities are more useful than the N-gram sentence
probability (16.1 % vs. 19.8 %; p < .01 by McNemar’s
test); secondly, tonal information helps on the
performance of the prosodic features (29.0% vs. 34.4%; p
< .0001); thirdly, treating the interjections as a special
tone is beneficial (27.0% vs. 29.0%; p <.0001).
We also trained a classifier using both the textual and
the prosodic features (feature selection was done on the
training set). The error rate of the classifier was 14.9%, a
1.2% reduction from using the textual features only. The
reduction is statistically significant (p < .05).
5. COMPARISON WITH ENGLISH
Our study on Chinese question detection made two
interesting findings: first, the word identity features are
more useful than the N-gram sentence probability, and the
utterance final word is the most useful textual feature;
second, the spectral balance of the final syllable is the
most useful prosodic feature, while utterance final pitch
features, don’t help. Previous studies on English question
detection have not directly compared the performance of
using word identities and using N-gram sentence
probability; and spectral balance has not been used as a
feature for English question detection. In this section we
report our experiments on English and make a comparison
between Chinese and English.
5.1. Data
The English data were taken from the CALLHOME
English corpus of telephone speech (LDC97S42) and its
transcripts (LDC97T14), using the same method as
obtaining the Chinese data. A considerable portion of the
English CALLHOME transcripts doesn’t contain
punctuations, and hence are not usable for this study. We
combined the training set and dev set of the English data.
The combined data set has 3172 datapoints, including
1586 statements and 1586 questions. We did 5 fold cross
validation on the combined data set in the following
experiments.

5.2. Textual features
We did feature selection on the same textual features as
used for Chinese, including both N-gram probability and
word identities. The results are listed in Table 7.
Table 7. Textual features selected by add-one-in (English)

Feature added
First word
+ ‘you’ or ‘your’
+ Wh-word
+ The number of words
Using N-gram sentence probability only

Error rate
26.2%
23.8%
23.3%
22.5%
29.0%

Compared to Chinese, the error rates are considerably
higher. This is probably because we have a smaller data
set for English.
The word identity features are more helpful than the Ngram sentence probability, just as we found for Chinese.
The most important textual feature, however, is the first
word instead of the last word. This is an expected result
because in English the yes-no questions start with
auxiliary verbs, whereas in Chinese the yes-no questions
end with a question marker.
5.3. Prosodic features
Table 8 lists the results of the prosodic feature selection,
starting with the features in Table 3 (the features were
extracted over words for English), plus the overall
intensity of the last word.
Table 8. Prosodic features selected by add-one-in (English)

Feature added
End (Pitch)
+Length (Duration)
+Last (Duration)
+Int_balance (Energy)
+Min (Pitch)

Error rate
36.5%
35.8%
35.0%
34.3%
34.2%

In English, quite differently than in Chinese, the pitch
at the end of the final word was first selected. This result
is consistent with the ToBI model of English intonation
[24], in which question intonation has a high boundary
tone. The difference between English and Chinese
suggests, on the other hand, that the boundary tone model
is not suitable for Chinese question intonation.
Both the overall intensity and the spectral balance were
included for feature selection, but only the spectral
balance was selected. This confirms that spectral balance
is a more reliable energy feature for question detection.
It is the spectral balance but not the utterance final pitch
features that were selected in both Chinese and English.
This result suggests that the language universal effect of

intonation is probably more related to energy than to
pitch. Further research is needed in this direction.
6. CONCLUSIONS
We investigated the features useful for Chinese question
detection and their relative importance. Our classifier
achieves an error rate of 14.9% with respect to a 50%
chance-level rate. We also compared the differences
between Chinese and English regarding feature
importance in question detection. We made the following
conclusions:
Specific features related to word identity are more
useful than using a full-sentence N-gram probability for
both Chinese and English question detection. The
utterance-final word is the most useful textual feature for
Chinese whereas the utterance-initial word is most useful
for English.
For question detection spectral balance is a more
reliable energy feature than the overall intensity. The
spectral balance of the final syllable is the most useful
prosodic feature for Chinese; the pitch at the end of the
utterance, however, is the most useful prosodic feature for
English. This result suggests that boundary tone is a
suitable intonation model for English but not for Chinese.
Tonal information helps Chinese question detection. It is
also helpful to categorize the interjection words as a
special tone.
