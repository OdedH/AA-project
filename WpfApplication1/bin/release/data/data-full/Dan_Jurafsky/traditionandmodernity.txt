Abstract
Scholars of Chinese literature note that
China’s tumultuous literary history in the
20th century centered around the uncomfortable tensions between tradition and modernity.
In this corpus study, we develop and automatically extract three features to show that
the classical character of Chinese poetry decreased across the century. We also ﬁnd that
Taiwan poets constitute a surprising exception to the trend, demonstrating an unusually
strong connection to classical diction in their
work as late as the ’50s and ’60s.

Introduction

For virtually all of Chinese history through the fall
of the Qing Dynasty, poetry was largely written in
Classical Chinese and accessible to a small, educated fraction of the population. With the rise of the
May Fourth Movement in 1919, prominent intellectuals such as Hu Shi and Lu Xun began to advocate
for and produce a fresh vernacular literature.
This upheaval of tradition has been much discussed in literary studies; Michelle Yeh calls vernacular poetry “a self-proclaimed iconoclast struggling against a formidable predecessor: the heritage
of three millennia of classical poetry” (Yeh, 1991).
While some propose that the May Fourth intellectuals “abolished the classical language and all of
its literary genres” (Hockx and Smits, 2003), others
make more measured claims: Mao Chen, for example, maintains that “a special relationship to tradition informs all phases of cultural activity during the
May Fourth period” (Chen, 1997).

Julia Lin notes that the period following the May
Fourth Movement through 1937 saw “the most exciting and diverse experimentation in the history of
modern Chinese poetry” (Lin, 1973). Much of this
experimentation was concerned with the question
of modernity versus tradition, wherein some poets
“adapt[ed] the reality of the modern spoken language to what they felt was the essence of the old
classical Chinese forms” (Haft, 1989).
The founding of the People’s Republic of China
in 1949 was a second major turning point in the
century, when “the Communists in one cataclysmic
sweep [...] ruthlessly altered the course of the arts”
and poetry “became totally subservient to the dictates of the party” (Lin, 1973). With the “physical removal of the old cultural leadership,” many of
whom ﬂed to Taiwan, this period saw a substantial
“vacuum in literature and the arts” (McDougall and
Louie, 1997).
Post-Mao, publication restrictions gradually loosened and earlier cultural journals re-entered circulation. Poetry began to reclaim its audience, and a
Chinese avant-garde associated with the “Misty Poets” developed (McDougall and Louie, 1997).
However, we lack broad-scale empirical evidence
of the linguistic features that constituted the shift
from tradition to modernity. Therefore, we propose
a study that asks: To what extent were classical poetic forms and classical language immediately discarded with the advent of vernacular poetry? What
is the status of classical language after 1949 and
amidst the Maoist era, when we might expect its total absence? Does more contemporary poetry still
draw connections to classical language?

Prior Work on Chinese Poetry in NLP

The majority of existing studies in NLP on Chinese
poetry deal exclusively with the classical language.
Jiang and Zhou (2008) explore the problem of
classical Chinese poetic couplets, and to develop a
system to generate them automatically using techniques from machine translation.
Fang et al. (2009) use an ontology of imagery developed by Lo (2008) to identify imagery in classical
Chinese poems, and develop a parser that is able to
extract tree structures that identify complex imagistic language in the same.
More recent work develops useful resources for
understanding classical poetry. Lee (2012) develops
a corpus of classical Chinese poems that are wordsegmented and annotated with nested part-of-speech
tags that allow for different interpretations of “wordhood” - a non-trivial concept in considering Chinese
texts classical and modern. Lee and Kong (2012)
introduce a large-scale dependency treebank annotated on a corpus of 8th-century poems.
To our knowledge, there is no existing computational work that attempts to understand the development of modern Chinese poetry over time.

Data Collection

For this project, we use a corpus of modern poems collected on the site “Chinese Poetry Treasury”
(中国诗歌库, www.shigeku.com) entitled the “Selected Database of Chinese Modern Poetry” (中国
现代诗歌精品资料库). It is important to note that
the poems in this collection were hand-selected by
the group running the site for their canonicity, so our
data are biased towards those poems that have, in a
sense, “stood the test of time” in the eyes of a mainland Chinese readership.
This corpus is distributed through their site as a
collection of html documents, one page per poet,
which include brief biographical information for the
poet and a collection of their works. We use unix
command-line tools (sed, tr, iconv, grep) and basic
python scripting to process these documents into a
usable corpus with each poem as a separate, clean
ﬁle, segmented character-by-character. 1

The site categorizes poets by their “most active”
decade, from the 1920s through the 1990s, and we
extract this metadata to allow for comparisons over
time. In our analysis, however, a methodological impediment arose: namely, the Cultural Revolution.
As discussed in the introduction, this tumultuous
period severely disrupted the developmental path of
modern Chinese literature. Indeed, we ﬁnd in our
corpus that almost none of the poets tagged as active
in the ’50s and ’60s were mainland Chinese, but instead Taiwanese poets who ﬂed to the island at the
climax of the Chinese Civil War.
For this reason, combined with the potential noisiness induced by the fact that decade tags are perpoet instead of per-poem, we manually identify Taiwan poets and divide our corpus into three subsets
for analysis: “early modern” poetry in the 1920s and
’30s; “late modern” poetry in the ’40s interrupted by
the Maoist era but resuming in the late ’70s, ’80s,
and ’90s; and “Taiwan” poetry by Taiwan natives
and transplanted mainlanders in Taiwan post-1949.
After pre-processing, our full corpus for analysis
(denoted Eval in Table 1) contains 3,611 poems by
305 poets, with a total of 1,128,428 Chinese characters. This size is large enough for meaningful computational results, but small enough to allow for signiﬁcant qualitative analysis.
We will later deﬁne metrics for evaluating the
“classicality” of individual characters and radicals,
so we process auxiliary corpora (denoted Aux in Table 1) of classical poetry and contemporary prose.
For classical Chinese, we use a large corpus, from
the same source (www.shigeku.com), of poems from
the Tang Dynasty (618-907 AD), often considered
the greatest classical era for Chinese poetry. For
modern Chinese, we use a subset of a machine translation bi-text, comprised primarily of contemporary
newswire, legal, and other prose texts.2
Since we aim to discover the overall “classicality”
of association for individual characters, our auxiliary corpora are cross-genre to exaggerate the effects — a high “classicality” score will indicate both
a period-speciﬁc classicality and a classical poetic
genre association.

Methodology
Speak in the language of the time in which you live.
— Hu Shi, 1917

As suggested in the introduction, modern poetry
is distinguished linguistically from classical poetry
in its explicit shift to the use of vernacular language.
Classical poetry is formalized, concise, and imagistic. We propose three features to operationalize this
classicality and computationally observe the shift to
a poetic vernacular across the 20th century.
Final Rhyme Classical Chinese poetry in general
has a highly regular structure, following strict metrical and rhyming conventions, and most prominently
employs a highly consistent end-rhyme. We use the
CJKLIB python library3 to obtain the pronunciation
for the last character in each line of each poem. The
pronunciation of a given Chinese character may be
divided into precisely one consonant (known as an
“initial”) and one vowel (known as a “ﬁnal”).
We therefore qualify a given line as “rhyming” if
the last character of any line within a 3-line window
shares its vowel ﬁnal pronunciation, and for each
poem calculate the proportion of rhyming lines.
Character-based Probability Ratio Inspired by
the work of Underwood and Sellers (2012) in tracking shifts in literary diction in English poetry, we use
our auxiliary corpora of Tang Dynasty poems and
modern Chinese language text to create two simple
metrics for understanding the “classicality” of poetic
diction.
The extreme concision of classical poetry “focuses attention on the characters themselves” (Hinton, 2010), with common classical forms containing
as few as ten or twenty characters. To analyze classical diction, for each character we aim to get a ratio
describing how classical it sounds.

For this metric, we calculate the probability of
each character occurring in its respective corpus using add-one smoothing. We then deﬁne the score
for a given character as the difference of the character’s log likelihood of occurring in the classical
auxiliary corpus with its log likelihood of occurring in the modern auxiliary corpus. Scores range
from -8 to +8, where a higher score indicates a more
“classically”-tinged character.
We ﬁnd these scores match up well with intuition. In the highly negative range, we ﬁnd recentlyinvented, conversational, and grammatical characters unique to the modern vernacular. In the highly
positive range, we ﬁnd rareiﬁed literary, poetic
characters. In the range surrounding 0.0, we ﬁnd
many common, persistent characters whose meanings have changed little over time. Selected examples of these scores can be seen in Table 2.

We calculate a score for a given poem on this metric by simply taking the average of the characterbased probability ratio for each character in the
poem. These results are denoted Char in Table 4.
Radical-based Probability Ratio This metric is
fundamentally similar to the above character-based
method, but offers the potential to provide a different
kind of insight. The majority of Chinese characters
are compositional, with a semantic component and a
phonetic component.

We start from the intuition that contemporary
texts will be more likely to use characters that contain the 口 (kou, “mouth”) radical as their semantic component, because this radical is commonly
found in modern conversational particles that were
not used in ancient texts. We generalize this hypothesis and consider that the use of characters with certain semantic radicals is correlated with the classicality of a text.
We again use the CJKLIB python library to process our auxiliary corpora, extracting the semantic component radical from each character and calculating the ratio of its probability of occurrence,
with add-one smoothing, in the auxiliary classical
and modern corpora. As above, we obtain the ratio
scores for each radical, and score each poem in our
corpus by averaging these scores for each character
in the poem.
While these scores are less immediately accessible to intuition than those of the character-based
metric, the radical-based scores, with examples seen
in Table 3, demonstrate a consistency that parallels
the character-based scores.
The semantic radicals most prevalent in classical
poetry include those signifying bird, horse, valley,
mountain, ghost, dragon, and so on; classical poetry has a pastoral and mythological aesthetic that
is directly reﬂected in the distribution of its radicals. Conversely, modern prose is more likely to use
semantic radicals related to work, family, money,
speech, and movement; they convey the practical realism of contemporary conversational speech.

Diachronic Statistical Analysis

We began from the hypothesis that each of the metrics described above will demonstrate, broadly, that
the classical nature of Chinese poetry decreased over
the course of the 20th century. The raw statistical
counts for our features can been seen in Table 4.
Table 4: Raw feature statistics across sub-corpora.
Higher values in the AVG rows indicate a greater “classicality.” For all three features, classicality decreased over
the century, with the exception of Taiwan.

We calculate the presence of the “classical” features deﬁned above for each subset, and compute
a binary logistic regression with the scikit-learn
python library (Pedregosa et al., 2011)4 to ﬁnd correlation coefﬁcients for those features between the
“early modern” and “late modern” subsets.

Results and Discussion

Several claims from the literary community are wellsupported by our results.
Logistic regression reveals a signiﬁcant downward trend for our features as we shift from “early
modern” to “late modern” poetry (R2 = 0.89), indicating decreased use of end-rhyme, increased use
of modern characters, and increased prevalence of
modern semantic radicals over the course of the century.
Though the early works use more classical characters on the whole, we also observe a higher statistical variance for all metrics in the ’20s and ’30s, supporting the literary hypothesis that the May Fourth
period was one of increased experimentation that
later settled into a somewhat more consistent modernity.
We ﬁnd, however, less support for the idea that
Chinese modern poets “abolished the classical language” in their work (Hockx and Smits, 2003).

Throughout the century we ﬁnd repeated instances
of highly classical language, with individual poems
reaching a maximum character-based probability ratio of 0.70 in the “early” works, 0.76 in the “late”
works, and 0.87 in the “Taiwan” works; compare
these with an average score of 1.20 for the auxiliary
classical dataset overall. Considering that a score of
0.0 would indicate an equal distribution of weight
between “classical” and “modern” characters, it’s
clear that these 20th-century poems still contain a
substantial proportion of characters drawn from the
classical language.
Poems from Taiwan in the ’50s and ’60s offer
perhaps the most interesting results in this study.
It’s notable in the ﬁrst place that poets in our corpus selected as worth remembering by contemporary mainland Chinese from the most authoritarian
period of Communist control are almost exclusively
from Taiwanese authors. Furthermore, the dip towards modernity we see in ’40s mainland poetry was
rejected in the next decade by those mainland poets
who found themselves in Taiwan after 1949; the Taiwan poems bear far greater resemblance to the early
subset of our data than to the late.
This ﬁnding parallels work on this period from literary scholars. Yvonne Chang writes that in ’50s
and ’60s Taiwan, valorization of traditional Chinese culture and romanticization of the early 20thcentury Nationalist period in mainland China was
heavily encouraged. In particular, the concept of “纯
文学” (chun wenxue, “pure literature”) gained popularity in Taiwan’s literary circles, and with it came
a resurgence of more traditional diction and forms
(Chang, 1993).
Fangming Chen further describes poetry in postwar Taiwan as a political outlet for the Kuomintang,
the sole ruling party of Taiwan at the time, as they
“forcefully brought Chinese nationalism” to the island. Poets who demonstrated a deep “nostalgia” for
the “motherland” of mainland China were far more
likely to be rewarded with cultural resources such as
grants and publication money, being that the government had a vested interest in keeping the public on
board with plans to “reclaim the homeland” (Chen,
2007). It is fascinating, then, that we observe this
tendency computationally with a return to the levels
of classicality seen in ’20s and ’30s mainland China.
In spite of these encouraging results, this work has

several limitations. Our reliance on decade-based labels applied to poets, rather than poems, introduces
signiﬁcant noise. The outlier behavior observed in
Taiwan poets is indicative of the need for a better
understanding of regional differences, and a comparison with a similarly isolated Sinophone region
such as Hong Kong would be productive in this regard. In both cases, information extraction techniques might allow us to tag poems with their date of
publication and poets with their hometown, facilitating ﬁne-grained analysis, as would a broader dataset
that goes beyond the modern canon.

Conclusion

In this paper, we computationally operationalized
three features that successfully track the declining
inﬂuence of classical poetic style and language in
20th-century Chinese poetry. We identiﬁed Taiwan
poets as an outlier in the dataset, and found empirical evidence for the political externalities of the ’50s
and ’60s that called for a return to a nostalgic classicism. In this way, this work presents a promising
ﬁrst step to a thorough empirical understanding of
the development of modern Chinese poetry.
