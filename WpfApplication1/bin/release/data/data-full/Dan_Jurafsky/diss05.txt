Abstract
The paper reports preliminary results on Mandarin filled
pauses (FPs), based on a large speech corpus of Mandarin
telephone conversation. We find that Mandarin intensively
uses both demonstratives (zhege ‘this’, nage ‘that’) and uh/ mm
as FPs. Demonstratives are more frequent FPs and are more
likely to be surrounded by other types of disfluency
phenomena than uh/mm, as well as occurring more often in
nominal environments. We also find durational differences: FP
demonstratives are longer than non-FP demonstratives, and
mm is longer than uh. The study also revealed dialectal
influence on the use of FPs. Our results agree with earlier work
which shows that a language may divide conversational labor
among different FPs. Our work also extends this research in
suggesting that different languages may assign conversational
functions to FPs in different ways.

1. Introduction
Filled Pauses (FPs) are prevalent in Mandarin spontaneous
speech and pose a major problem in Mandarin speech
recognition. Although much work related to English and other
languages has been done [1, 3, 5, 6], little empirical work on
Mandarin FPs in spontaneous speech has been carried out.
Previous work on Mandarin spontaneous speech, such as
Tseng [7], mainly focuses on repairs and repetitions. The lack
of research on FPs directly leads to the confusion of FP
judgments and random use of characters in transcribing
Mandarin speech. It is therefore necessary to identify the
distinctive forms of FPs in Mandarin and to investigate their
acoustic features and discourse functions.
The goal of the present work is to carry out a descriptive
study of Mandarin FPs. More specifically, the study aims at
identifying FPs and investigating their basic acoustic
properties and distribution across syntactic units. In addition,
it also examines the sociolinguistic variables that might
influence speakers’ use of FPs.

2. Method
The research was mainly based on the data drawn from LDC
98-HUB5 Mandarin corpus of telephone conversations, in
which FPs such as uh and mm are hand-labeled by LDC. There
are 37 conversations in the corpus, which have complete
speaker information. Only the callers’ information can be

identified, which is shown in Table 1.

In addition, in order to see how FPs vary across corpora,
another two LDC telephone conversation corpora, 2003-HUB5
and 96-CallHome, were also used for identifying distinctive
forms of FPs in Mandarin. Demonstrative FPs were
hand-labeled by the first author.

3. Results and discussion
3.1 How many FPs are there in Mandarin?
Four FPs are systematically used in three corpora, including uh,
mm, and the demonstratives zhege (literally “this”) and nage
(literally “that”), as shown in Table 2.

In general, the total frequency of FPs (10.69 per 1000 words)
seems to be smaller than in English. In the CallHome English
corpus, for example, um occurs 7.15 times per 1000 words,
and uh occurs 7.10 times per 1000 words.
Like Japanese and Spanish, besides reduced vowel FPs,
Mandarin intensively employs demonstratives as FPs [4, 9]. In
fact, demonstratives form the largest FP category in Mandarin.
We also investigated other potential FPs, but found only these
four (nage/zhege/uh/mm) seemed to act as true FPs. For

conversation.

were found to occur mainly before syntactic constituents, such
as before clauses, as shown in (a); before predicate VPs as
shown in (b) and before complements as shown in (c). Another
location where FPs frequently occur is within an NP constituent,
such as between a modifier and a noun head, as shown in (d):

The basic acoustic features of the FPs, such as duration and
pitch movement were measured from a sample of 100 FPs
produced by male speakers, which are summarized in Table 3.
It was found that the duration of mm is over 1.5 times
longer than that of uh and the difference is highly significant
(t=3.306, p<.002, MD=.2053). In English, uh and um contrast
mainly in the delays they initiate [1]. However, in the 100
samples of Mandarin uh/mm FP, less than 5 cases have pauses
around them, which might indicate that Mandarin speakers tend
to prolong the vowel or the nasal to fill an entire pause. This
suggests that Mandarin FPs divide their labor according to the
length of pause they need to fill: mm tends to fill a longer pause
and uh tends to fill a shorter pause.
We also compared demonstrative FPs with their non-FP
uses. It was found that the duration of both zhege and nage is
significantly longer than their non-FP uses respectively
(t=5.531, p<.001, MD=.2052) (t=6.278, p<.004, MD=.1882). In
this case, FP demonstratives are around two times longer than
their non-FP counterparts. No significant difference between
the duration of zhege and nage was found. In addition, the
statistics shows that the pitch of FP nage is significantly higher
than that of non-FP nage (t=1.356, p<.024, MD=23.52).

Figure 1 suggests that most uh and mm are used clause initially.
In addition, the occurrences of uh and mm decrease as the
syntactic units become smaller and simpler. Grammatical
weight theory predicts that speaker would encounter more
planning problems before larger syntactic constituents [8]. Our
result on FPs of uh/mm is in accordance with what grammatical
weight theory predicts. In this case, the larger and more
complex a constituent is, the more likely an uh/mm FP is to
occur before it.
Contrasting with uh/mm FPs, demonstrative FPs are most
likely to occur before complements, especially NP
complements. In addition, unlike uh and mm, which are rarely
used between a modifier and a noun head, demonstratives also
occur frequently in this nominal environment. As shown in
Table 4, 34% of nage and 28.4% of zhege occur before NP
complement and 18.4% of nage and 23.5% of zhege occur
before noun head. Demonstratives nage and zhege occur in
nominal environments 52.4% and 51.9% of the time,
respectively. Demonstrative FPs therefore contrast greatly with
uh/mm in occurring in nominal-related disfluency environments.
This suggests that demonstrative FPs may play a role in
nominal search in Mandarin. We can formalize this suggestion
as the "Nominal-Search Hypothesis": speakers are more likely
to choose demonstratives as FPs when they encounter
nominal-search problems in Mandarin

repeated, may suggest that demonstratives are more indicative
of more serious planning problems. On the other hand, speakers
may simply be using other strategies to indicate severe planning
problems with uh and mm. For example, uh and mm could be
prolonged to indicate severity, as suggested in [1]. This issue
clearly calls for further investigation.
3.5 Social variables and filled pauses
Finally, the study examined speakers’ demographic factors and
their influence on the use of FPs. These factors include gender,
age, education and place of growing up.
Figure 2 shows the distribution of FPs among individual
southern and northern speakers. A t-test shows that place of
growing up has a significant effect on the number of FPs being
used. Speakers growing up in the south of China use
significantly more FPs than those grow up in the north (t=3.431,
p<.002). The main distinction lies in the total amount of uh.
Southerner use significantly more uh as FPs than northerners
(t=2.888, p<0.002). We found no significant effect in the use of
nasal mm between northern and southern speakers

3.4 Disfluencies around FPs

Mean

Research such as [1, 2, 8] has shown that some FPs signal
larger planning problems than others. One way to investigate
which FPs represent bigger planning problems is to examine
neighboring disfluencies occurring around the FPs. The
distribution of disfluencies before and after the four types of
FPs is summarized in Table 5.

The result in Table 5 suggests that demonstrative FPs are more
likely to be accompanied by other types of disfluency
phenomenon than uh/mm. For example, demonstrative FPs are
often repeated several times and followed by other disfluencies.
In comparison, uh and mm are not that likely to be
accompanied by other type of disfluencies. The fact that
demonstrative FPs are more likely than uh and mm to be
followed by other disfluencies, and far more likely to be

Sex, age and education do not have a significant effect on the
use of FPs. Previous work on English FPs revealed that FP
rates are related to demographic factors such as sex. Men
produced significantly higher rates of FPs than women [6]. Our
study does not find similar results in Mandarin; sex does not
have a significant effect on the use of FPs in Mandarin (t=-.315,
p<.755 ). Although sex alone does not have significant effect
on the use of FPs, the interaction between sex and place of
growing up turns out to be significant (F=3.823, p<.019). The
mean number of FPs used by a southern female speaker is the
highest and that of a northern male speaker is the lowest.
In addition, we found no significant effect of education
level on the use of FP, although we did find a trend for speakers
with more education to use fewer FPs than those with less

education.

4. Conclusion
The paper presents preliminary results of a study on Mandarin
FPs. Through comparing three corpora, four major FPs were
identified. It revealed that apart from uh and mm, Mandarin
speakers intensively use demonstratives as one major type of
FPs. Demonstratives and uh/mm FPs differ in their distribution
among syntactic contexts. Namely, demonstratives are more
frequently used in nominal-searching environments, while uh
and mm are more likely to be used clause-initially. The two
types of FPs also contrast greatly in the amount of surrounding
disfluencies. Demonstratives were found to be more likely
accompanied by repetitions, false starts etc., while uh/mm were
only rarely accompanied by other disfluencies. In addition,
southern speakers tend to make use of more FPs in
conversation than northern speakers, which may suggest
dialectal influence on the use of FPs in Mandarin.
This paper provides only a preliminary picture of
Mandarin FPs. Much more work needs to be done in the
future.
