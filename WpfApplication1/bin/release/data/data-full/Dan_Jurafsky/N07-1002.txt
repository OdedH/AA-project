Abstract

Hirschberg, 2000) are quite useful; content words
are much more likely to be accented than function
words, and words with higher probability are less
likely to be prominent. More sophisticated linguistic features have also been used, generally based on
information-structural notions of contrast, focus, or
given-new. (Hirschberg, 1993).

The immense prosodic variation of natural conversational speech makes it challenging to predict which words are prosodically prominent in
this genre. In this paper, we examine a new feature, accent ratio, which captures how likely it is
that a word will be realized as prominent or not.

For example, in the Switchboard utterance below, there is an intrinsic contrast between the words
“women” and “men”, making both terms more
salient (words in all capital letters represent prominent tokens):

We compare this feature with traditional accentprediction features (based on part of speech and
N -grams) as well as with several linguistically motivated and manually labeled information structure
features, such as whether a word is given, new, or

contrastive. Our results show that the linguistic fea-

tures do not lead to signiﬁcant improvements, while

Similarly the givenness of a word may help determine its prominence. The speaker needs to focus the
hearer’s attention on new entities in the discourse, so
these are likely to be realized as prominent. Old entities, on the other had, need not be prominent; these
tendencies can be seen in the following example.

accent ratio alone can yield prediction performance
almost as good as the combination of any other subset of features. Moreover, this feature is useful even
across genres; an accent-ratio classiﬁer trained only
on conversational speech predicts prominence with
high accuracy in broadcast news. Our results suggest that carefully chosen lexicalized features can
outperform less ﬁne-grained features.

1 Introduction
Being able to predict the prominence or pitch accent
status of a word in conversational speech is important for implementing text-to-speech in dialog systems, as well as in detection of prosody in conversational speech recognition.
Previous investigations of prominence prediction
from text have primarily relied on robust surface features with some deeper information structure features. Surface features like a word’s part-of-speech
(POS) (Hirschberg, 1993) and its unigram and bigram probability (Pan and McKeown, 1999; Pan and
0
Thanks to the Edinburgh-Stanford Link and ONR (MURI
award N000140510388) for generous support.

While previous models have attempted to capture global properties of words (via POS or unigram
probability), they have not in general used word
identity as a predictive feature, assuming either that
current supervised training sets would be too small
or that word identity would not be robust across genres (Pan et al., 2002). In this paper, we show a way
to capture word identity in a feature, accent ratio,
that works well with current small supervised training sets, and is robust to genre differences.
We also use a corpus which has been handlabeled for information structure features (including
given/new and contrast information) to investigate
the relative usefulness of both linguistic and shallow
features, as well as how well different features combine with each other.

2 Data and features
For our experiments we use 12 Switchboard (Godfrey et al., 1992) conversations, 14,555 tokens in total. Each word was manually labeled for presence
or absence of pitch accent1 , as well as additional
features including information status (or givenness),
contrast and animacy distinctions, (Nissim et al.,
2004; Calhoun et al., 2005; Zaenen et al., 2004), features that linguistic literature suggests are predictive
of prominence (Bolinger, 1961; Chafe, 1976).
All of the features described in detail below have
been shown to have statistically signiﬁcant correlation with prominence (Brenier et al., 2006).
Information status The information status (IS),
or givenness, of discourse entities is important for
choosing appropriate reference form (Prince, 1992;
Gundel et al., 1993) and possibly plays a role in
prominence decisions as well (Brown, 1983). No
previous studies have examined the usefulness of
information status in naturally occurring conversational speech. The annotation in our corpus is based
on the givenness hierarchy of Prince: ﬁrst mentions
of entities were marked as new and subsequent mentions as old. Entities that are not previously mentioned, but that are generally known or semantically
related to other entities in the preceding context are
marked as mediated. Obviously, the givenness annotation applies only to referring expressions, i.e.
noun phrases the semantic interpretation of which is
a discourse entity. This restriction inherently limits
the power of the feature for prominence prediction,
which has to be performed for all classes of words.
Complete details of the IS annotation can be found
in (Nissim et al., 2004).
Kontrast One reason speakers make entities in
an utterance prominence is because of information
structure considerations (Rooth, 1992; Vallduv´ and
ı
Vilkuna, 1998). That is, parts of an utterance which
distinguish the information the speaker actually says
from the information they could have said, are made
salient, e.g. because that information answers a
question, or contrasts with a similar entity in the
context. Several possible triggers of this sort of
salience were marked in the corpus, with words that
were not kontrastive (in this sense) being marked as
background:
1

Of all tokens, 8,429 (or 58%) were not accented.

• contrastive if the word is directly differentiated
from a previous topical or semantically-related
word;
• subset if it refers to a member of a more general
set mentioned in the surrounding context;
• adverbial if a focus-sensitive adverb such as
“only” or “even” is associated with the word
being annotated;
• correction if the speaker intended to correct or
clarify a previous word or phrase;
• answer if the word completes a question by the
other speaker;
• nonapplic for ﬁller phrases such as “in fact”, “I
mean”, etc.
Note that only content words in full sentences
were marked for kontrast, and ﬁller phrases such
as “in fact” and “I mean” were excluded. A complete description of the annotation guidelines can be
found in (Calhoun et al., 2005).
Animacy Each noun and pronoun is labeled for the
animacy of its referent (Zaenen et al., 2004). The
categories include concrete, non-concrete, human,
organizations, place, and time.
Dialog act Speciﬁes the function of the utterance
such as statement, opinion, agree, reject, abandon;
or type of question (yes/no, who, rhetoric)
In addition to the above theoretically motivated
features, we used several automatically derivable
word measures.
Part-of-speech Two such features were used, the
full Penn Treebank tagset (called POS) , and a collapsed tagset (called BroadPOS) with six broad categories (nouns, verbs, function words, pronouns, adjectives and adverbs).
Unigram and bigram probability These features
are deﬁned as log(pw ) and log(pwi |pwi−1 ) respectively and their values were calculated from the
Fisher corpus (Cieri et al., 2004). High probability
words are less likely to be prominent.
TF.IDF This measure captures how central a word is
for a particular conversation. It is a function of the
frequency of occurrence of the word in the conversation (nw ), the number of conversations that contain the word in a background corpus (k) and the
number of all conversations in the background corpus (N ). Formally, TF.IDF1 = nw × log( N ). We
k

also used a variant, TF.IDF2, computed by normalizing TF.IDF1 by the number of occurrences of the
most frequent word in the conversation. TF.IDF2 =
TF.IDF1/max(nw∈conv ). Words with high TF.IDF
values are important in the conversation and are
more likely to be prominent.
Stopword This is a binary feature indicating if the
word appears in a high-frequency stopword list from
the Bow toolkit (McCallum, 1996). The list spans
both function and content word classes, though numerals and some nouns and verbs were removed.
Utterance length The number of words.
Length The number of characters in the words. This
feature is correlated with phonetic features that have
been shown to be useful for the task, such as the
number of vowels or phones in the word.
Position from end/beginning The position of the
word in the utterance divided by the number of
words that precede the current word.
Accent ratio This ﬁnal (new) feature takes the
“memorization” of previous productions of a given
word to the extreme, measuring how likely it is that
a word belongs to a prominence class or not. Our
feature extends an earlier feature proposed by (Yuan
et al., 2005), which was a direct estimate of how
likely it is for the word to be accented as observed
in some corpus. (Yuan et al., 2005) showed that the
original accent ratio feature was not included in the
best set of features for accent prediction. We believe
the reason for this is the fact that the original accent ratio feature was computed for all words, even
words in which the value was indistinguishable from
chance (.50). Our new feature incorporates the signiﬁcance of the prominence probability, assuming a
default value of 0.5 for those words for which there
is insufﬁcient evidence in the training data. More
speciﬁcally,
k
n

if B(k, n, 0.5) ≤ 0.05
0.5 otherwise
where k is the number of times word w appeared
accented in the corpus, n is the total number of
times the word w appeared, and B(k, n, 0.5) is
the probability (under a binomial distribution) that
there are k successes in n trials if the probability of success and failure is equal. Simply put,
the accent ratio of a word is equal to the estimated probability of the word being accented if this
AccentRatio(w) =

11

probability is signiﬁcantly different from 0.5, and
equal to 0.5 otherwise. For example, AccentRatio(you)=0.3407, AccentRatio(education)=0.8666,
and AccentRatio(probably)=0.5.
Many of our features for accent prediction are
based only on the 12 training conversations. Other
features, such as the unigram, bigram, and TF*IDF
features, are computed from larger data sources. Accent ratio is also computed over a larger corpus,
since the binomial test requires a minimum of six
occurrences of a word in the corpus in order to get
signiﬁcance and assign an accent ratio value different from 0.5. We thus used 60 Switchboard conversations (Ostendorf et al., 2001), annotated for pitch
accent, to compute k and n for each word.

3 Results
For our experiments we used the J48 decision trees
in WEKA (Witten and Frank, 2005). All the results
that we report are from 10-fold cross-validation on
the 12 Switchboard conversations.
Some previous studies have reported results on
prominence prediction in conversational speech with
the Switchboard corpus. Unfortunately these studies
used different parts of the corpus or different labelings (Gregory and Altun, 2004; Yuan et al., 2005),
so our results are not directly comparable. Bearing this difference in mind, the best reported results
to our knowledge are those in (Gregory and Altun,
2004), where conditional random ﬁelds were used
with both textual, acoustic, and oracle boundary features to yield 76.36% accuracy.
Table 1 shows the performance of decision tree
classiﬁers using a single feature. The majority class
baseline (not accented) has accuracy of 58%. Accent
ratio is the most predictive feature: the accent ratio
classiﬁer has accuracy of 75.59%, which is two percent net improvement above the previously known
best feature (unigram). The accent ratio classiﬁer
assigns a “no accent” class to all words with accent
ratio lower than 0.38 and “accent” to all other words.
In Section 4 we discuss in detail the accent ratio dictionary, but it is worth noting that it does correctly
classify even some high-frequency function words
like “she”, “he”, “do” or “up” as accented.

Combining features

We would expect that a combination of features
would lead to better prediction when compared to
a classiﬁer based on a single feature. Several past
studies have examined classes of features. In order
to quantify the utility of different speciﬁc features,
we ran exhaustive experiments producing classiﬁers
with all possible combinations of two, three, four
and ﬁve features.
As we can see from ﬁgure 1 and table 2, the classiﬁers using accent ratio as a feature perform best,
for all sizes of feature sets. Moreover, the increase
of performance compared to a single-feature classiﬁer is very slight when accent ratio is used as feature. Kontrast seems to combine well with accent
ratio and all of the best classiﬁers with more than
one feature use kontrast in addition to accent ratio.
This indicates that automatic detection of kontrast
can potentially help in prominence prediction. But
the gains are small, the best classiﬁers without kontrast but still including accent ratio perform within
0.2 percent of the classiﬁers that use both.
On the other hand, classiﬁers that do not use accent ratio perform poorly compared to those that do,
and even a classiﬁer using ﬁve features (unigram,
broad POS, token length, position from beginning
and bigram) performs about as well as a classiﬁer
using solely accent ratio as a feature. Also, when
accent ratio is not used, the overall improvement of
the classiﬁer grows faster with the addition of new
features. This suggest that accent ratio provides rich
information about words beyond that of POS class
and general informativeness.2
Table 2 gives the speciﬁc features in (n + 1)feature classiﬁers that lead to better results than the
best n-classiﬁer. The ﬁgures are for the classiﬁers
performing best overall. Interestingly, none of these
best classiﬁers for all feature set sizes uses POS or
unigram as a feature. We assume that accent ratio
captures all the relevant information that is present
in the unigram and POS features. The best classiﬁer
with ﬁve features uses, in addition to accent ratio,
kontrast, tf.idf, information status and distance from
the beginning of the utterance. All of these features
convey somewhat orthogonal information: seman2
To verify this we will examine the accent ratio dictionary
in closer detail in the next section.

tic, topicality, discourse and phrasing information
respectively. Still, all of them in combination improve the performance over accent ratio as a single
feature only by one percent.
Figure 1 shows the overall improvement of classiﬁers with the addition of new features in three scenarios: overall best, best when kontrast is not used
as a feature and best with neither kontrast nor accent ratio. The best classiﬁer with ﬁve features that
do not include kontrast has accent ratio, broad POS,
word length, stopword and bigram as features and
has accuracy of 76.28%, or just 0.27% worse than
the overall best classiﬁer that uses kontrast and information status. This indicates that while there is
some beneﬁt to using the two features, they do not
lead to any substantial boost in performance. Strikingly, the best classiﬁer that uses neither accent ratio nor kontrast performs very similarly to a classiﬁer using accent ratio as the only feature: 75.82%
for the classiﬁer using unigram, POS, tf.idf1, word
length and position from end of the utterance.

The power of linguistic features

One of the objectives of our study was to assess how
useful gold-standard annotations for complex linguistic features are for the task of prominence prediction. The results in this section indicate that animacy distinctions (concrete/non-concrete, person,
time, etc) and dialog act did not have much power

ing more likely to be pronominalized. In the numerous cases where pronominalization of old information does occur, features such as POS, unigram or
accent ratio will be sensitive to the change of information status simply based on the lexical item.
Kontrast is by far the most useful linguistic feature. It is used in all of the best classiﬁers for any
feature set size (table 2). It applies to more words
than givenness does, since salience distinctions can
be made for any part-of-speech class. Still, not all
words were annotated for kontrast either, and moreover kontrast only captures one kind of semantic
salience. This is particularly true of discourse markers like “especially” or “deﬁnitely”: these would either be in sentence fragments that weren’t marked
for kontrast, or would probably be marked as ’background’ since they are not salience triggers in a semantic sense. As we can see from ﬁgure 1, classiﬁers that use kontrast perform only slightly better
than others that use only “cheaper” features.

as individual features (table 1) and were never included in a model that was best for a given feature
set size (table 2).
Information status is somewhat useful and appears in the overall best classiﬁer with ﬁve features
(table 2). But when compared with other classiﬁers
with the same number of features, the beneﬁts from
adding information status to the model are small.
For example, the accent ratio + information status
classiﬁer performs 0.23% better than accent ratio
alone, but so does the classiﬁer using accent ratio
and tf.idf. There are two reasons that can explain
why the givenness of the referent is not as helpful
as we might have hoped. First of all, the information status distinction applies only to referring expressions and has undeﬁned values for words such
as verbs, adjectives or function words. Second, information status of an entity inﬂuences the form of
referring expression that is used, with old items be13

Contrary to our initial expectations, both classes in
the accent ratio dictionary (for both low and high
probability of being prominent) cover the full set of
possible POS categories. Tables 3 and 4 list words in
both classes (with words sorted by increasing accent
ratio in each column). The “no accent” class is dominated by function words, but also includes nouns
and verbs. One of the drawbacks of POS as a feature for prominence prediction is that normally auxiliary verbs will be tagged as “VB”, the same class
as other more contentful verbs. The informativeness
(unigram probability) of a word would distinguish
between these types of verbs, but so does the accent
ratio measure as well.
Furthermore, some relatively frequent words such
as “too”, “now”, “both”, “no”, “yes”, “else”, “wow”
have high accent ratio, that is, a high probability for
accenting. Such distinctions within the class of function words would not be possible on the basis of in-

formativeness, POS, or even information structure
features. Another class like that is words like “yes”,
“okay”, “sure” that are mostly accented by virtue of
being the only word in the phrase.
Some rather common words, “not” for example,
are not included in the accent ratio dictionary because they do not exhibit a statistically strong preference for a prominence class. The accent ratio classiﬁer would thus assign class “accented” to the word
“not”, which is indeed the class this word occurs in
more often.
Another fact that becomes apparent with the inspection of the accent ratio dictionary is that while
certain words have a statistically signiﬁcant preference for deaccenting, there is also a lot of variation
in their observed realization. For example, personal
pronouns such as “I” and “you” have accent ratios
near 0.33. This means that every third such pronoun
was actually realized as prominent by the speaker.
In a conversational setting there is an implicit contrast between the two speakers, which could partly
explain the phenomenon, but the situations which

speech will be the focus of a future linguistic investigation.
Kontrast is helpful in predicting “accented” class
for some generally low ratio words. However, even
with its help, production variation in the conversations cannot be fully explained. The following examples from our corpus show low accent ratio words
(that, did, and, have, had) that were produced as
prominent.

they’re going to HAVE to WORK it OUT to WORKING
part TIME.

The examples attest to the presence of variation
in production: in the ﬁrst utterance, for example, we
see the words “did”, “and” and “that” produced both
as prominent and not prominent. Intonational phrasing most probably accounts for some of this variation since it is likely that even words that are typically not prominent will be accented if they occur
just before or after a longer pause. We come back to
this point in the closing section.

5 Robustness of accent ratio
While accent ratio works well for our data (Table
2), a feature based so strongly on memorizing the
status of each word in the training data might lead
to problems. One potential problem, suggested by
Pan et al. (2002) for lexicalized features in general,
is whether a lexical feature like accent ratio might
be less robust across genres. Another question is
whether our deﬁnition of accent ratio is better than
one that does not use the binomial test: we need to
investigate whether these statistical tests indeed improve performance. We focus on these two issues in
the next two subsections.
Binomial test cut-off
As discussed above, the original accent ratio feature
(Yuan et al., 2005) was based directly on the fraction of accented occurrences in the training set. We
might expect such a use of raw frequencies to be
problematic. Given what we know about word distributions in text (Baayen, 2001), we would expect
about half of the words in a big corpus to appear only
once. In an accent ratio dictionary without binomial
test cut-off, all such words will have accent ratio of
either exactly 1 or 0, but one or even few occurrences
of a word would not be enough to determine statistical signiﬁcance. By contrast, our modiﬁed accent
ratio feature uses binomial test cut-off to make the
accent ratio more robust to small training sets.
To test if the binomial test cut-off really improved
the accent ratio feature, we compared the performance on Switchboard of classiﬁers using accent
ratio with and without cut-off. The binominal test
improved the performance of the accent ratio feature from 73.49% (Yuan et al. original version) to
75.59% (our version).
Moreover, Yuan et al. report that their version of
the feature did not combine well with other features,
while in our experiments best performance was always achieved by the classiﬁers that made use of the
accent ratio feature in addition to others.
A cross-genre experiment: broadcast news
In a systematic analysis of the usefulness of different informativeness, syntactic and semantic features
for prominence prediction, Pan et al. (2002) showed
that word identity is a powerful feature. But they hy15

pothesized that this would not be a useful feature in
a domain independent pitch accent prediction task.
Their hypothesis that word identity cannot be a robust across genres would obviously carry over to accent ratio. In order to test the hypothesis, we used
the accent ratio dictionary derived from the Switchboard corpus to predict prominence in the Boston
University Radio corpus of broadcast news. Using
an accent ratio dictionary from Switchboard and assigning class “not accented” to words with accent ratio less than 0.38 and “accented” otherwise leads to
82% accuracy of prediction for this broadcast news
corpus. If the accent ratio dictionary is built from
the BU corpus itself, the performance is 83.67%. 3
These results indicate that accent ratio is a robust
enough feature and is applicable across genres.

6 Conclusions and future work
In this paper we introduced a new feature for prominence prediction, accent ratio. The accent ratio of
a word is the (maximum likelihood estimate) probability that a word is accented if there is a signiﬁcant preference for a class, and 0.5 otherwise. Our
experiments demonstrate that the feature is powerful both by itself and in combination with other features. Moreover, the feature is robust to genre, and
accent ratio dictionaries can be used for prediction
of prominence in read news with very good results.
Of the linguistic features we examined, kontrast
is the only one that is helpful beyond what can be
gained using shallow features such as n-gram probability, POS or tf.idf. While the improvements from
kontrast are relatively small, the consistency of these
small improvements suggest that developing automatic methods for approximating the gold-standard
annotation we used here, similar to what has been
done for information status in (Nissim, 2006), may
be worthwhile. An automatic predictor for kontrast
may also be helpful in other applications such as
question answering or textual entailment.
All of the features in our study were text-based.
There is a wide variety of research investigating
phonological or acoustic features as well. For example Gregory and Altun (2004) used acoustic features
3
This result is comparable with the result of (Yuan et al.,
2005) who in their experiment with the same corpus report the
best result as 83.9% using three features: unigram, bigram and
backwards bigram probability.

such as duration and energy, and phonological features such as oracle (hand-labeled) intonation phrase
boundaries, and the number of phones and syllables in a word. Although acoustic features are not
available in a text-to-speech scenario, we hypothesize that in a task where such features are available
(such as in speech recognition applications), acoustic or phonological features could improve the performance of our text-only features. To test this hypothesis, we augmented our best 5-feature classiﬁer
which did not include kontrast with hand-labeled intonation phrase boundary information. The resulting
classiﬁer reached an accuracy of 77.45%, more than
one percent net improvement over 76.28% accuracy
of the model based solely on text features and not including kontrast. Thus in future work we plan to incorporate more acoustic and phonological features.
Finally, prominence prediction classiﬁers need to
be incorporated in a speech synthesis system and
their performance should be gauged via listening
experiments that test whether the incorporation of
prominence leads to improvement in synthesis.
