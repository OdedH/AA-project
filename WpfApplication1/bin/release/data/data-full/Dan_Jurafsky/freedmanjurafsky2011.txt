Food is a robust marker of group identity. What you
had for dinner yesterday says a lot about your national identity, ethnicity, or social class, and this link between food
and culture has ﬁlled the pages of blogs, cookbooks, and
journals—evidence of the ubiquity of our verbal fascination with food. The breadth of the writing (covering many
genres, social classes, geographic regions, and age groups)
and the depth (many examples of each type of food writing)
suggest that food descriptions themselves might be a superb
way to investigate many of these linked cultural and social
factors. In this article we take up the challenge, asking
whether the language of food can reveal something about
the representation and perception of socioeconomic class
identity in contemporary America.
Language, of course, is also a powerful marker of group
identity. Regional accents are widely used as markers of
local afﬁliation, and language differences are closely related
to socioeconomic class. In an inﬂuential study of speech
in New York in the 1960s, William Labov showed that
accents correlate very strongly with socioeconomic status.
Working-class speakers drop the “r” in words like quarter
and park, while upper-middle-class speakers pronounce the
“r,” following the standard American “prestige” pronunciation.1 These facts have long been clear to politicians, who
are especially likely to pronounce the “-ing” sufﬁx as “-in”
(goin’, likin’) when speaking to working-class audiences.2
Linguistic style is thus a resource that language users
employ and recognize for claiming and marking class identity and class aspiration.
When trying to identify with or target a particular
group like the working class, speakers do more than just
alter pronunciations. They use vocabulary and metaphors
designed to appeal to a particular constituency. By studying
these metaphors and phrasings, it is possible to uncover the
subtle presuppositions underlying our everyday language
and expose the attitudes that speakers believe their audiences hold. Because food descriptions are so widespread
and so broad in their audience, they provide an excellent

tool for this analysis. We propose to study differences in the
representation of socioeconomic status in contemporary
America by studying the words and metaphors employed in
one genre of food writing: food advertising. Our goal is to
examine advertising texts directed at different classes to see
how the words express representations of class identity. We
also explore the closely linked concept of authenticity—the
idea that some aspects of culture, lifestyle, class identity, or
language are in some way more authentic than others.
Comparing targeted language requires a food that is
consumed by all social classes, yet comes wrapped in textual
description. We chose the great American snack food: potato
chips. Consumers across wide socioeconomic lines eat these
snacks, which are available in many different brands at a
wide range of prices. Furthermore, the advertising language
on the packaging offers a number of linguistic indicators
presumably designed to appeal to differing consumers.
Our goal, then, is to explore whether advertising on
chips targeted toward consumers of high socioeconomic
status uses different language than that on chips designed to
appeal to lower status consumers. We hope to better understand how advertisers distinguish the concepts of food for
the upper class and the working class or lower-middle class
in America. How are different social identities expressed
in modern America with respect to food culture? What in
particular is the role of working-class or lower-middle-class
identity? Of course, by investigating advertising language
our study is perforce indirect: it can only tell us about social
class through the language that advertisers use to appeal
to them. Nonetheless, analyzing advertising language, like
analyzing the language of politicians, gives us a window
into how a particular speaker models class differences,
which is an important component of how class is treated in
public discourse.

Our study examines the language on twelve bags of
potato chips. We used all potato chip brands available
at neighborhood supermarkets, and for each brand took
the most basic ﬂavor of chip in the most standard size package. For most of our studies we simply separated the chips
into two groups, six more expensive and six less expensive
based on price per ounce. This separation relies on the
fact that lower-class consumers are more price-elastic and
price-sensitive (especially for nonessentials like snacks) and
factor cost more highly into food purchasing decisions.3,4
Other factors, including standard package size (larger
packages for inexpensive chips),5 further indicate that this
bifurcation reﬂects a real distinction between upscale
and downscale chips.
The more expensive chips, or those targeted at
higher-class consumers, are Boulder, Dirty, Kettle Brand,
popchips, Terra, and Season’s, which average sixty-eight
cents per ounce. The inexpensive chips (Hawaiian, Herr’s,
Lays, Tim’s, Utz, and Wise) average forty cents per ounce.
Separation into two groups is not as ﬁne-grained as the continuous relationship between price and advertising words, so
for other studies, as we discuss below, we also model price
as a continuous variable.

Education and health are two factors that have been
strongly associated with differences in socioeconomic status
for a long time. Indeed, education is one of the main ways
that class status is deﬁned in social scientiﬁc studies, along
with work and income. The link between health and class
has been robustly documented: studies in the United States
and many other countries over the last 100 years have found
higher mortality rates in people of lower-class status.6
We, therefore, begin our study with these two variables.
If the language used on expensive chips is indeed designed
in some way to appeal to consumers of higher status, we
expect to see advertisers attempt to appeal to these consumers by creating differences in the educational level of the
text itself and in how the text talks about health.
To conﬁrm this link between educational capital and
advertising vocabulary, we examined the potato chip advertising language from the perspective of linguistic complexity,
which is known to correlate with education level.7 Texts at
higher levels of complexity are longer, use more complex

grammar, and use rarer words than texts at lower levels.8
Complexity itself is not a measure of socioeconomic status;
every speaker tends to use more complex language in some
situations (such as writing documents for work) than others
(conversations or emails with friends). Because educational
capital does vary with socioeconomic status, however, advertisers may attempt to appeal to these consumers by using
complex language as a marker. If so, we predict that more
expensive chips would be packaged in more complex language.
We investigated this prediction using the Flesch-Kincaid
readability test, which measures how difﬁcult a text is to
comprehend. A text’s Flesch-Kincaid number is a weighted
value of the length of each sentence in the text (longer
sentences tend to be more complex) and the length of each
word in the text in syllables (longer words tend to be harder
to read): the lower the metric, the more complex the language. We computed the Flesch-Kincaid readability metric
for all the sentences on every bag of chips.9
As predicted, expensive chips use more complex language than inexpensive chips. Expensive chips have a lower
(more complex) Flesch-Kincaid score (48; about tenth to
eleventh grade level) when compared to the inexpensive
chips (56; about eighth grade level).10
Expensive chips also have more words overall (142
words per bag, compared to 104 words per bag for the
inexpensive chips).11 Notice in the following examples that
although both chips focus on manufacturing process and
taste, the expensive chip uses longer and more complex
sentences and words:
Inexpensive: “What gives our chips their exceptional great taste? It’s no
secret. It’s the way they’re made!”
Expensive: “We use totally natural ingredients, hand-rake every batch,
and test chips at every stage of preparation to ensure quality and taste.”

In addition to having fewer and shorter words, the inexpensive chips use more common words. Using a standard
measure of word commonality based on how frequently
the words occur in standard reference texts, we assigned
each word on all the packages a frequency score. On
average, words on expensive chips had a frequency of six
occurrences per thousand in the Switchboard reference
corpus, while inexpensive chip words were 33 percent more
frequent (a frequency of eight occurrences per thousand).12
Uncommon words that occur in the expensive chip advertising but not the inexpensive chips include ﬂuorescent, ﬂair,
savory, and culinary. Common words that occur in the inexpensive chip language but not that of the expensive chips
include fresh, light, basic, and extra.

The second factor, health, was surprisingly prevalent:
potato chips are not objectively a healthy food, yet most of
the chips we studied emphasized the healthiness of their
products, using phrases like 0 grams trans fat, healthier, no
cholesterol, lowest sodium level, never fried, and low fat.13
Though many chips include at least one word related to
health, we still found striking differences. Expensive chips
talk about health six times as much as inexpensive chips
(about six times per bag versus once per bag).14 Most of the
expensive chips emphasize their lack of msg and gluten,
and every expensive chip notes that it is lower in fat and
completely lacks trans fats.
Again, this difference in health language is not, as far as
we can tell, due to actual differences in the chips. None of
the chips in our sample contain trans fats, but while all six
of the expensive ones mention the lack of trans fats, only
two out of the six inexpensive chips mention it.
These differences conﬁrm that on expensive chip packaging,
advertisers use signiﬁcantly more words or claims relating
to health than on inexpensive chip packaging. This result,
along with our ﬁnding that expensive chips use more complex
language, reinforces our hypothesis that food advertising
language is a window into the targeting and representation
of different socioeconomic groups. We need to look deeper,
however, to investigate more subtle distinctions in the
advertising language and their reﬂections on social class.

Distinction
In matters of taste, more than anywhere else, all determination is negation; and tastes are perhaps ﬁrst and foremost
distastes, disgust provoked by horror or visceral intolerance
(‘sick-making’) of the tastes of others.
—Bourdieu, Distinction: A Social Critique of the Judgement of Taste

Pierre Bourdieu’s groundbreaking work on the sociology of
tastes and culture illustrated that position in society heavily inﬂuences taste in food, just like taste in music, ﬁlm,
or art.15 Bourdieu surveyed French society in the 1960s,
examining the daily habits and tastes of high-status upper
class and the lower-status working class. Tastes in music

Health

and painting correlated strongly with class position, ranging from the “popular” tastes of the working class for the
Blue Danube Waltz to the preferences of the high-status
class for the Well-Tempered Clavier or Breughel. In food,
the lower class expressed preferences for traditional hearty
meals, heavy in starch and fat and generous in portion size.
The high-status classes instead tended to value and eat more
exotic foods, such as newly arriving ethnic foods like curry,
or health foods like brown rice.
Bourdieu proposed that many of these tastes of the highstatus class functioned as a public indicator of class, with
the goal of maintaining status by distinguishing upper-class
culture from those of the others, independent of inherent
artistic merit. A high-status group maintains its status by
legitimizing some tastes but not others and by passing on
these tastes as cultural preferences.16
To test whether Bourdieu’s distinction plays a similar role
in food advertising directed at different classes in modern
America, we looked at words that explicitly emphasize or
contrast differences between expensive and inexpensive chips.
One way to differentiate is to compare with other chips,
using linguistic markers of comparison such as the words
more or less, sufﬁxes like –er, or superlative words (most, least,
best, ﬁnest). Phrases like “best in America” or “less fat than
other leading brands,” or relational words like unique, for
example, assert that one kind of chip possesses some quality
or ingredient (goodness, ﬁneness, fat) to a greater or lesser
extent than some other kind of chip, thus acting to differentiate one brand of chips from another. Geoffrey Leech has
shown that this kind of emphasis on the uniqueness of a
product is characteristic of advertising language in general.17
A second way to differentiate is to use linguistic negation (“nothing fake” or “never baked”). A negative marker
is a word or afﬁx whose meaning changes truth values.
Negative markers can be adverbs or particles like not or
never, quantiﬁers like no, verbal clitics like n’t in don’t or
didn’t, a pronoun like nothing or no one, verbs with negative meaning like deny or avoid, or preﬁxes like un- or mis-.
In chip advertising, negation is used to emphasize bad
qualities that a chip does not have, implicating that other
brands have this bad quality.
We coded each use of comparatives and negation and
compared expensive to inexpensive chips. The results support
our hypothesis: distinction is used ﬁve times more frequently
in expensive chips. On average a distinction-related word or
phrase is mentioned fourteen times on each expensive bag;
inexpensive chips, by contrast, use distinction words fewer than
three times per bag.18 The table on page 50 shows a number
of examples of the use of distinction in expensive chips:

More expensive chips thus come wrapped in more
complex language, presumably designed to draw a potential
buyer into believing that the product is somehow consonant
with his or her educational capital.

The difference between expensive and inexpensive
chips is particularly striking with negation. Expensive chips
use negation fourteen times as often as inexpensive chips
(more than nine uses of negation per expensive bag, versus
only two-thirds of a single use per inexpensive bag). We
also tested a more ﬁne-grained relation between negation
and price by running a linear regression to relate the number of negation instances with the price per ounce. We
found that each additional negation word on a chip package is associated with an increase of about four cents in the
price per ounce.19 Here is a particularly salient example
from the most expensive chip brand, popchips: “nothing
fake or phony. no fake colors, no fake flavors, no fluorescent
orange fingertips, no wiping your greasy chip hand on
your jeans. no, really.”
One reason we did not expect negation to be such
a popular strategy is that linguistic negation is linked to
negative feelings or emotions; as Chris Potts20 and Michael
Israel21 have shown, linguistic negation is more likely to
be used when the context being discussed includes repudiation, rejection, deprivation, and evil.22 The fact that
advertisers nonetheless use negation in such large amounts
indicates the strength of this attempt to distinguish their
product from competing chips.
This link between negation and food description goes
beyond potato chips. As a research report from the language
of food politics project at the United Kingdom’s Open
University points out, “Organic food and farming are often
described as what they are not”; among the most frequent
words in the organic food literature are words “referring
unfavorably to nonorganic farming.”23 The marketing of
organic food thus implicitly or explicitly deﬁnes organic

farming by contrast with nonorganic farming. Of course,
organic food has a similar link with the educated and the
upper class,24 suggesting that this use of negation in the
area of organic foods is also related to class status and
Bourdieu’s distinction.
In summary, advertising on more expensive potato
chips is vastly more likely to use language that compares
the brand to other brands, or that relies on negation to
implicitly denigrate undesirable properties of other brands.
These striking differences support Bourdieu’s claim that an
important component of taste is negative. The notion of
upper-class taste promulgated or reinforced by food advertising is one that is deﬁned at least partially to contrast with
tastes of other classes; what it is to be upper class is to be
not lower class. As Adam Drewnowski, an epidemiologist at
the University of Washington, told Newsweek, “In America,
food has become the premier marker of social distinctions,
that is to say—social class. It used to be clothing and fashion, but no longer, now that ‘luxury’ has become affordable
and available to all.”25

Authenticity
While our research shows that advertisers use negative
language to emphasize product differences, there are also
positive attributes of a brand that consumers or advertisers
desire to emphasize. One of these attributes is authenticity,
which has been called “one of the cornerstones of contemporary marketing.”26 Mentions of authenticity in food and
dining have increased sharply in the last twenty years,27 and
recent studies have looked at food language to analyze how
advertisers and consumers understand authenticity in food.
Through interviews with luxury winemakers and
consumers, Michael B. Beverland showed that in addition to high quality and consistency, historicity (old ﬁrms
emphasize their early founding and long histories, as well
as rituals like their links with the Burgundy wine auctions;
younger ﬁrms emphasize stories of their recent founders),
relationship to place (in particular the concept of terroir),
traditional method of production and focus on the ingredients, and the downplaying of commercial motivations are
among the factors that contribute to a luxury wine being
considered “authentic.”28 Beverland and colleagues found
similar results in a study of consumer attitudes toward
Trappist beer brewed in Belgium and the Netherlands:
Trappist beers were considered more authentic if they were
more historic or traditional, if they had a relationship to
place, and if they were seen to be small, handcrafted productions by artisans with little commercial motivation.29

classes (or advertisers targeting them). While Bourdieu and
recent Bourdovian work tend to associate authenticity only
with the preferences of the upper class, the work of DeVault
and Holt leads to a prediction that inexpensive chip advertising may promote authenticity as well. The authenticity
promoted for a lower socioeconomic class would presumably be a different type of authenticity, emphasizing family
and the tradition and historicity of the product. We would
thus expect more mention of words like tradition and more
references to the company’s founders, tradition, and associated local geographic regions.
Because potato chips, unlike luxury wines, are not
ancient products historically associated with the upper class,
we might not expect the same emphasis on historicity in
expensive chips. But other aspects of authenticity, such as
an emphasis on the ingredients, the cooking process, and
naturalness, seem likely to play an important role in this
domain.35 For expensive chips, we thus hypothesize they
will use language that emphasizes the naturalness of the
product and focuses on the ingredients, their provenance,
and their cooking process.
We once again coded all bags for uses of these four categories of authenticity words:
Naturalness: uses of the phrases natural or naturally, real (as in real
food), as well as negative phrases like absolutely nothing artiﬁcial, or
no artiﬁcial ﬂavor.
Ingredients/process: mentions of ingredients and their processing
(Yukon Gold potatoes, ﬁnest ingredients, sea salt, premium potatoes,
peanut oil).
Historicity: mention of tradition (family recipe, traditional recipe), or

Locality: mention of a geographic location where the chips are made
(America, Hawaii, in the great Paciﬁc Northwest).

We found that naturalness is 2.5 times more likely to be
mentioned on expensive bags (a natural word or phrase is
mentioned on average about seven times on each expensive
bag but fewer than three times on each inexpensive bag).
Ingredients are also 2.5 times more likely to be mentioned on
expensive bags, and process about three times more likely.36
Historicity and locality, by contrast, were both more
common on inexpensive chips (more than twice per bag
each) than expensive chips (less than once per bag each).
Combining these two variables, and after controlling for text
length, each additional mention of historicity or locality is
associated with a ten cent decrease in the price per ounce.37
The table on page 52 shows examples of these results.

GASTRONOMICA

These features of authenticity in upscale wine and beer
are consistent with what appears in upscale food writing.
Josée Johnston and Shyon Baumann looked at the language
used in every article that appeared in 2004 in four upscale
food magazines: Bon Appétit, Saveur, Food and Wine, and
Gourmet, conﬁrming that these magazines framed food as
high status by emphasizing authenticity.30 Food is presented
as authentic by virtue of its locality (every article talked about
food coming from particular places like Bologna, Italy, New
Iberia, Louisiana, or Vietnam’s Phu Quoc island); simplicity
(89 percent of articles emphasized food which was handmade
rather than industrially produced, rural rather than urban in
origin); and historicism (76 percent of the articles focused on
food that had a long historical tradition of being produced
in the area). Similarly, the fervor among upper-middle-class
eaters for local regional eating, for the use of natural rather
than artiﬁcial ingredients, and an obsession about the quality and origins of the ingredients and their cooking process
permeate upscale culinary magazines and discourse.
The search for authenticity in the modern upscale
consumer is not just conﬁned to tastes in food and drink.
The New York Times recently called the word authentic “a
buzzword for selling handmade products,” noting that “the
exultation of the ‘authentic’ reaches near-hilarious heights
in the design community, with young bloggers creating
endless catalogs of ‘authentic’ items like denim or Prouvé
chairs.”31 A wide variety of studies conﬁrm this trend, such
as those of James H. Gilmore and B. Joseph Pine.32 As
social critic Andrew Potter points out, “when we take a
closer look at many supposedly ‘authentic’ activities, such
as loft-living, ecotourism, or the slow-food movement, we
ﬁnd a disguised form of status-seeking.”33
These activities described by Potter are characteristic
of the upper class. Yet some aspects of authenticity, such
as the historicism or locality discussed by Johnston and
Baumann in food or Beverman in wine or beer, might
just as well characterize working-class taste. The work of
sociologist Marjorie DeVault, for example, who showed
that working-class women are more likely to base the kinds
of foods they cooked on traditional dishes, suggests that
working-class or lower-middle-class identity is more likely to
be based around family and tradition.34 Holt (1994), in his
study of Americans in rural Pennsylvania, similarly found
that lower-class consumers were more likely to eat traditional
and conventional foods. This preference for traditional
meal structures and family recipes in the working classes
mirrors what Bourdieu found in France ﬁfty years earlier.
These results suggest that authenticity in food may mean
different things for consumers of different socioeconomic

In contrast with concepts like negation or health, which
we found to be a factor mainly for expensive chips, authenticity
is a positive quality that appears both in expensive and inexpensive chips. The two classes are differentiated instead by
exactly how they deﬁne authenticity.
For the upper class, being authentic means being
natural, using quality natural ingredients and avoiding
artiﬁcial ingredients, preservatives, and so on. Words like
artiﬁcial or fake are used solely in the expensive chip
advertising. Even though most of the inexpensive chips
also contain no preservatives, this fact is only mentioned
in expensive chip advertising. This emphasis on authentic
food as natural and nonartiﬁcial is prevalent in the popular
press as well in books like Michael Pollan’s In Defense
of Food, which contains rules for avoiding what Pollan
calls “imitation foods:”38

Baumann and Beverland found historicity and locality to be
properties of upscale food and wine. We hypothesize that
the difference lies in the domains. The locales and histories that Johnston and Baumann found in magazines like
Saveur were the history of poor ethnic people in faraway
exotic locales. Historicity and locality are thus “exotic” properties of the other. Historicity and locality in Beverland’s
wine interviews were properties of a traditionally upper-class
product with centuries of prestige. The historicity in potato
chip advertising, on the other hand, is neither that of the
poor exotic locales that might be a bourgeois travel destination, nor the upscale European wine producers that are
linked with the upper class. Instead, potato chips highlight
the history of empowered non-ethnic Americans running
family businesses with whom the consumer is intended to
identify. The historicity and locality discovered by Johnston
and Baumann and Beverland, by contrast, might be better
described as an indicator of distinction, distinguishing the
consumer who is able to appreciate the exotic ﬁsh sauce or
luxury wine producer.

By contrast, for the working class, authenticity is rooted
in historicity, including family tradition, the model of a
company as a family business with an explicit founder, and
regional American locations.

a corpus of spoken rather than written English to measure the frequency of each
word in the advertising. Each word in the advertising was assigned its frequency
in the two-million-word Switchboard corpus of spoken American English (J. Godfrey,
E. Holliman, and J. McDaniel, “switchboard: Telephone Speech Corpus for
Research and Development,” Proceedings of ieee icassp [1992], 517–521). We
then compared the average frequency (measured in expected number of occurrences per million words) of the words in the expensive and inexpensive chip
packages. The difference is statistically signiﬁcant (p = .0015).

grain of salt. Nonetheless, our work suggests that the advertising for expensive chips indeed emphasizes factors that
are more representative of higher socioeconomic status: use
of more complex language, known to correlate with higher
educational levels, and use of more words and claims
related to health.
We explored deeper implications of the differences in
advertising language. Pierre Bourdieu hypothesized that
taste is fundamentally negative, and our investigation of
the language of potato chip advertising supports his theory.
The fact that expensive chip advertising is full of comparison
(less fat, ﬁnest potatoes) and negation (not, no, never, don’t,
won’t) suggests that at least one important goal of the image
of upper-class food tastes promulgated by food advertising in
contemporary America is to distance the upper classes from
lower socioeconomic classes and their tastes. An additional
implication of our result is the importance of negation as
a linguistic device: the amount of negation in expensive
chip advertising is extraordinary. While distinction also was
emphasized through positive comparisons and words like
different, negation was a vastly more commonly used technique.
Our results also have implications for the relationship
between authenticity and socioeconomic status. Previous
scholars have often suggested that the desire for authenticity is solely linked with upper-class identity; our results,
however, suggest that this may only be partially true. If the
advertising language indeed captures veridical aspects of
upper-class identity, what’s linked with the upper class is
merely one form of authenticity, which might be called
natural authenticity. For the advertising model of the upper
classes, authentic food is natural, healthy, and not artiﬁcial
or processed. The working class, at least in the minds of
advertisers, seems to maintain an equally valid model of
authenticity, which might be called traditional authenticity. For this socioeconomic stratum, authentic food is
traditional, American, rooted in family recipes and family
traditions, and located in the American landscape.
The authentic experience is thus linguistically coded
for the lower socioeconomic class, both phonetically, by
the use of particular pronunciations (like the –in’ pronunciation of the “-ing” afﬁx), and conceptually, by reference
to tradition and historicity. The authentic experience is
linguistically coded for the upper socioeconomic class by
its emphasis on health and natural living. While the classes
may use different metaphors for deﬁning the authentic
experience, both seek it out. Authenticity, in its various
forms, is a product of all socioeconomic classes and is
widespread throughout contemporary America—just like
the potato chip itself.g

13. We coded each mention of a health-related word or phrase on the bags.
Thus, a clause like “our potato crisps are low in fat and have no trans fats” would
count as two mentions of health, one for “low in fat” and one for “no trans fats,”
because these are independent claims.

14. Expensive chips have 6.67 mentions of health per bag, compared to 1.00
mentions on inexpensive bags. The difference is signiﬁcant (p=.003). Because
expensive chips have 60 percent more words per bag, on average, we also ran
statistics after normalizing these counts per words. Expensive chips have on average .05 health mentions per word, while inexpensive bags have on average .01
health mentions per word. The difference is still quite signiﬁcant (p=.015). A
linear regression of health mentions against price per ounce showed each additional health mention was associated with a seven cent increase in price
per ounce, r2=.53.

18. The difference in distinction words between expensive (14.0) and inexpensive
chips (2.71) is statistically signiﬁcant (p=.002); controlling for length by using distinction words per total word, the difference is still signiﬁcant (p=.01).
19. Expensive chips had 9.33 uses of negation, compared to .57 uses for inexpensive chips. This difference is signiﬁcant (p=.004); the difference is still signiﬁcant
after controlling for length (p=.007). In the linear regression of distinction terms
against price per ounce, the r2=.61.

22. This link between negative linguistic terms and negative emotions, while
clear to copywriters, has received less attention from linguists and philosphers,
who traditionally have deﬁned negation solely as reversing the truth value of
sentences. For example, Frege pointed out early on that “A negation may occur
anywhere in a sentence without making the thought indubitably negative.” The
use of negation in chip advertising seems to have this aspect of what Potts calls
“pragmatic negativity”; the negatives are used about something (fat, preservatives,
msg) that are presumed to be bad or harmful. For an excellent discussion of the
linguistic and philosophical literature that does deal with this and other aspects
of negation, see Laurence R. Horn, A Natural History of Negation (Chicago:

36. Naturalness is mentioned on average 7.2 times on expensive chip bags and
2.4 times on inexpensive bags; the difference is signiﬁcant (p=.01). When normalizing for length, the difference declined to a trend, close to signiﬁcance (p=.07).
Ingredients or the cooking process is mentioned 5.8 times per expensive bag, 1.9
per inexpensive bag. The difference is signiﬁcant both before (p=.005) and after
(p=.04) controlling for length.
37. Historicity is mentioned 2.3 times on inexpensive chip bags, compared to 1.0
time on expensive bags, a difference that is signiﬁcant whether controlling for
length (p=.01) or not (p=.04). Locations are mentioned 2.0 times on inexpensive
bags, compared to 0.7 times on expensive bags, signiﬁcant when controlling
for length (p=.01) or not (p=.04). A linear regression of historicity plus location
against price per ounce, controlled for length, has an r2=.54.
