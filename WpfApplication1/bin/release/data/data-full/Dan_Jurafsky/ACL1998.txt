Abstract
The probabilistic relation between verbs and
their arguments plays an important role in
modern statistical parsers and supertaggers,
and in psychological theories of language
processing. But these probabilities are
computed in very different ways by the two
sets of researchers. Computational linguists
compute verb subcategorization probabilities
from large corpora while psycholinguists
compute them from psychological studies
(sentence production and completion tasks).
Recent studies have found differences
between
corpus
frequencies
and
psycholinguistic measures.
We analyze
subcategorization frequencies from four
different corpora: psychological sentence
production data (Connine et al. 1984), written
text (Brown and WSJ),
and telephone
conversation data (Switchboard). We find
two different sources for the differences.
Discourse influence is a result of how verb
use is affected by different discourse types
such as narrative, connected discourse, and
single sentence productions.
Semantic
influence is a result of different corpora using
different senses of verbs, which have different
subcategorization frequencies. We conclude
that verb sense and discourse type play an
important role in the frequencies observed in
different experimental and corpus based
sources of verb subcategorization frequencies.

Introduction

The probabilistic relation between verbs and their
arguments plays an important role in modern
statistical parsers and supertaggers (Charniak
1995, Collins 1996/1997, Joshi and Srinivas 1994,
Kim, Srinivas, and Trueswell 1997, Stolcke et al.

1997), and in psychological theories of language
processing (Clifton et al. 1984, Ferreira &
McClure 1997, Garnsey et al. 1997, Jurafsky 1996,
MacDonald 1994, Mitchell & Holmes 1985,
Tanenhaus et al. 1990, Trueswell et al. 1993).
These probabilities are computed in very different
ways by the two sets of researchers.
Psychological studies use methods such as
sentence completion and sentence production for
collecting verb argument structure probabilities.
In sentence completion, subjects are asked to
complete a sentence fragment. Garnsey at al.
(1997) used a proper name followed by a verb,
such as "Debbie remembered _____."
In
sentence subjects are asked to write any sentence
containing a given verb. An example of this type
of study is Connine et al. (1984).
An alternative to these psychological methods is
to use corpus data.
This can be done
automatically with unparsed corpora (Briscoe and
Carroll 1997, Manning 1993, Ushioda et al. 1993),
from parsed corpora such as Marcus et al.'s (1993)
Treebank (Merlo 1994, Framis 1994) or manually
as was done for COMLEX (Macleod and
Grishman 1994). The advantage of any of these
corpus methods is the much greater amount of
data that can be used, and the much more natural
contexts. This seems to make it preferable to
data generated in psychological studies.
Recent studies (Merlo 1994, Gibson et al. 1996)
have found differences between corpus
frequencies and experimental measures. This
suggests that corpus-based frequencies and
experiment-based frequencies may not be
interchangeable. To clarify the nature of the
differences between various corpora and to find
the causes of these differences, we analyzed

ACL 1998

psychological sentence production data (Connine
et al. 1984), written discourse (Brown and WSJ
from Penn Treebank - Marcus et al. 1993), and
conversational data (Switchboard - Godfrey et al.
1992). We found that the subcategorization
frequencies in each of these sources are different.
We performed three experiments to (1) find the
causes of general differences between corpora, (2)
measure the size of these differences, and (3) find
verb specific differences. The rest of this paper
describes our methodology and the two sources of
subcategorization
probability
differences:
discourse influence and semantic influence.

Methodology

For the sentence production data, we used the
numbers published in the original Connine et al.
paper as well as the original data, which we were
able to review thanks to the generosity of Charles

Clifton. The Connine data (CFJCF) consists of
examples of 127 verbs, each classified as
belonging to one of 15 subcategorization frames.
We added a 16th category for direct quotations
(which appeared in the corpus data but not the
Connine data). Examples of these categories,
taken from the Brown Corpus, appear in figure 1
below. There are approximately 14,000 verb
tokens in the CFJCF data set.
For the BC, WSJ, and SWBD data, we counted
subcategorizations using tgrep scripts based on the
Penn Treebank. We automatically extracted and
categorized all examples of the 127 verbs used in
the Connine study. We used the same verb
subcategorization categories as the Connine study.
There were approximately 21,000 relevant verb
tokens in the Brown Corpus, 25,000 relevant verb

tokens in the Wall Street Journal Corpus, and
10,000 in Switchboard. Unlike the Connine data,
where all verbs were equally represented, the
frequencies of each verb in the corpora varied.
For each calculation where individual verb
frequency could affect the outcome, we
normalized for frequency, and eliminated verbs
with less than 50 examples. This left 77 out of
127 verbs in the Brown Corpus, 74 in the Wall
Street Journal, and only 30 verbs in Switchboard.
This was not a problem with the Connine data
where most verbs had approximately 100 tokens.

Experiment 1

The purpose of the first experiment is to analyze
the general (non-verb-specific) differences
between argument structure frequencies in the
data sources. In order to do this, the data for each
verb in the corpus was normalized to remove the
effects of verb frequency.
The average
frequency of each subcategorization frame was
calculated for each corpus.
The average
frequencies for each of the data sources were then
compared.

3.1

Results

We found that the three corpora consisting of
connected discourse (BC, WSJ, SWBD) shared a
common set of differences when compared to the
CFJCF sentence production data. There were
three general categories of differences between the
corpora, and all can be related to discourse type.
These categories are:
(1) passive sentences
(2) zero anaphora
(3) quotations
3.1.1 Passive Sentences
The CFJCF single sentence productions had the
smallest number of passive sentences.
The
connected spoken discourse in Switchboard had
more passives, followed by the written discourse
in the Wall Street Journal and the Brown Corpus.

Passive is generally used in English to emphasize
the undergoer (to keep the topic in subject
position) and/or to de-emphasize the identity of
the agent (Thompson 1987). Both of these
reasons are affected by the type of discourse. If
there is no preceding discourse, then there is no
pre-existing topic to keep in subject position. In
addition, with no context for the sentence, there is
less likely to be a reason to de-emphasize the
agent of the sentence.
3.1.2 Zero Anaphora
The increase in zero anaphora (not overtly
mentioning understood arguments) is caused by
two factors.
Generally, as the amount of
surrounding context increases (going from single
sentence to connected discourse) the need to
overtly express all of the arguments with a verb
decreases.

Verbs that can describe actions (agree, disappear,
escape, follow, leave, sing, wait) were typically
used with some form of argument in single
sentences, such as:
“I had a test that day, so I really wanted to escape
from school.” (CFJCF data).

Such verbs were more likely to be used without
any arguments in connected discourse as in:
“She escaped , crawled through the usual mine
fields, under barbed wire, was shot at, swam a
river, and we finally picked her up in Linz.”
(Brown Corpus)

In this case, the argument of “escaped”,
(“imprisonment”) was understood from the
previous sentence.
Verbs of propositional
attitude (agree, guess, know, see, understand) are
typically used transitively in written corpora and
single-sentence production:
“I guessed the right answer on the quiz.”
(CFJCF).

In spoken discourse, these verbs are more likely to
be used metalinguistically, with the previous

ACL 1998

Page 4

discourse contribution understood as the argument
of the verb:
“I see.” (Switchboard)
“I guess.” (Switchboard)

3.1.3 Quotations
Quotations are usually used in narrative, which is
more likely in connected discourse than in an
isolated sentence. This difference mainly effects
verbs of communication (e.g. answer, ask, call,
describe, read, say, write).

Our procedure for measuring the effect of
discourse is as follows (illustrated using passive
as an example):
1. Measure the difference between two corpora

2. Remove differences caused by discourse
effects (based on BC vs CFJCF). CFJCF has
22% the number of passives that BC has.

These verbs are used in corpora to discuss details
of the contents of communication:

10%

“Turning to the reporters, she asked, `Did you
hear her?’”(Brown)

5%

In single sentence production, they are used to
describe the (new) act of communication itself

We are currently working on systematically
identifying indirect quotes in the corpora and the
CFJCF data to analyze in more detail how they fit
in to this picture.

Experiment 2

Our first experiment suggested that discourse
factors
were
the
primary
cause
of
subcategorization differences. One way to test
this hypothesis is to eliminate discourse factors
and see if this removes subcategorization
differences.
We measure the difference between the way a verb
is used in two different corpora by counting the
number of sentences (per hundred) where a verb in
one corpus would have to be used with a different
subcategorization in order for the two corpora to
yield the same subcategorization frequencies.
This same number can also be calculated for the
overall subcategorization frequencies of two
corpora to show the overall difference between the
two corpora.

% Passive - BC vs CFJCF
We then linearly scale the number of passives
found in WSJ to reflect the difference found
between BC and CFJCF.

This method was applied to the passive, quote,

that show discourse-based differences. Before

law: “The President noted that Congress last year

test: “Those who T stayed had * to pass tests.”

We then asked two questions:
1. Do different verb senses have different
argument structure preferences?
2. Do different corpora have different verb
sense preferences, and therefore potentially
different argument structure preferences?
For both verbs examined (pass and charge) there
was a significant effect of verb sense on argument
structure probabilities (by X2 p <.001 for ‘charge’
and p <.001 for ‘pass’). The following chart
shows a sample of this difference:

Argument preference was also affected by verb
semantics. To examine this effect, we took two
sample ambiguous verbs, “charge” and “pass”.
We hand coded them for semantic senses in each
of the corpora we used as follows:

We then analyzed how often each sense was used
in each of the corpora and found that there was
again a significant difference (by X2 p <.001 for
‘charge’ and p <.001 for ‘pass’).

We use this mapping procedure to measure the
size and consistency of the discourse effects. A
more sophisticated mapping procedure would be
appropriate for other purposes since the verbs with
the best matches between corpora are actually
made worse by this mapping procedure.

the mapping, WSJ has a difference of 17
frames/100 overall difference when compared
with CFJCF. After the mapping, the difference
is only 9.6 frames/100 overall difference. This
indicates that 43% of the overall cross-verb
differences between these two corpora are caused
by discourse effects.

This analysis shows that it is possible for shifts in
the relative frequency of each of a verbs senses to
influence the observed subcat frequencies.
We are currently extending our study to see if verb
senses
have
constant
subcategorization
frequencies across corpora. This would be useful
for word sense disambiguation and for parsing.
If the verb sense is known, then a parser could use
this information to help look for likely arguments.
If the subcatagorization is known, then a
disambiguator could use this information to find
the sense of the verb. These could be used to
bootstrap each other relying on the heuristic that
only one sense is used within any discourse (Gale,
Church, & Yarowsky 1992).

Evaluation

We had previously hoped to evaluate the accuracy
of our treebank induduced subcategorization
probabilities by comparing them with the
COMLEX hand-coded probabilities (Macleod and

ACL 1998

Page 6

Grishman 1994), but we used a different set of
subcategorization frames than COMLEX.
Instead, we hand checked a random sample of our
data for errors.

to find arguments that were located to the left of
the verb. This is because arbitrary amounts of
structure can intervene, expecially in the case of
traces.

The error rate in our data is between 3% and 7%
for all verbs excluding ‘say’ type verbs such as
‘answer’, ‘ask’, ‘call’, ‘read’, ‘say’, and ‘write’.
The error rate is given as a range due to the
subjectivity of some types of errors. The errors
can be divided into two classes; errors which are
due to mis-parsed sentences in Treebank1, and
errors which are due to the inadequacy of our
search strings in indentifying certain syntactic
patterns.
Treebank-based errors

NP/adverbial distinction
2%
misc. miss-parsed sentences
1%
Errors based on our search strings
missed traces and displaced arguments
1%
“say” verbs missing quotes
6%
Error rate by category

Six percent of the data (overall) was improperly
classified due to the failure of our search patterns
to identify all of the quote-type arguments which
occur in ‘say’ type verbs. The identification of
these elements is particularly problematic due to
the asyntactic nature of these arguments, ranging
from a sound (He said ‘Argh!’) to complex
sentences. The presence or absense of quotation
marks was not a completely reliable indicator of
these arguments. This type of error affects only
a small subset of the total number of verbs. 27%
of the examples of these verbs were mis-classified,
always by failing to find a quote-type argument of
the verb. Using separate search strings for these
verbs would greatly improve the accuracy of these
searches.

In trying to estimate the maximum amount of
error in our data, we found cases where it was
possible to disagree with the parses/tags given in
Treebank.
Treebank examples given below
include prepositional attachment (1), the verbparticle/preposition distinction (2), and the
NP/adverbial distinction (3).
1.
“Sam, I thought you [knew [everything]NP
[about Tokyo]PP]” (BC)
2.
“...who has since moved [on to other
methods]PP?” (BC)
3.
“Gross stopped [briefly]NP?, then went on.”
(BC)
Missed traces and displaced argument errors were
a result of the difficulty in writing search strings
1

All of our search patterns are based only on the
information available in the Treebank 1 coding system,
since the Brown Corpus is only available in this
scheme. The error rate for corpora available in
Treebank 2 form would have been lower had we used
all available information.

Our eventual goal is to develop a set of regular
expressions that work on flat tagged corpora
instead of TreeBank parsed structures to allow us
to gather information from larger corpora than
have been done by the TreeBank project (see
Manning 1993 and Gahl 1998).

Conclusion

We find that there are significant differences
between the verb subcategorization frequencies
generated through experimental methods and
corpus methods, and between the frequencies found
in different corpora. We have identified two
distinct sources for these differences. Discourse
influences are caused by the changes in the ways
language is used in different discourse types and
are to some extent predictable from the discourse
type of the corpus in question.
Semantic
influences are based on the semantic context of the
discourse. These differences may be predictable
from the relative frequencies of each of the possible
senses of the verbs in the corpus. An extensive
analysis of the frame and sense frequencies of
different verbs across different corpora is needed to
verify this. This work is presently being carried
out by us and others (Baker, Fillmore, & Lowe
1998). It is certain, however, that verb sense and

ACL 1998
discourse type play an important role in the
frequencies observed in different experimental and
corpus based sources of verb subcategorization
frequencies
