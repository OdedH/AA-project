Abstract
Many factors are thought to increase the
chances of misrecognizing a word in ASR,
including low frequency, nearby disﬂuencies,
short duration, and being at the start of a turn.
However, few of these factors have been formally examined. This paper analyzes a variety
of lexical, prosodic, and disﬂuency factors to
determine which are likely to increase ASR error rates. Findings include the following. (1)
For disﬂuencies, effects depend on the type of
disﬂuency: errors increase by up to 15% (absolute) for words near fragments, but decrease
by up to 7.2% (absolute) for words near repetitions. This decrease seems to be due to longer
word duration. (2) For prosodic features, there
are more errors for words with extreme values
than words with typical values. (3) Although
our results are based on output from a system
with speaker adaptation, speaker differences
are a major factor inﬂuencing error rates, and
the effects of features such as frequency, pitch,
and intensity may vary between speakers.

1 Introduction
In order to improve the performance of automatic
speech recognition (ASR) systems on conversational
speech, it is important to understand the factors
that cause problems in recognizing words. Previous
work on recognition of spontaneous monologues
and dialogues has shown that infrequent words are
more likely to be misrecognized (Fosler-Lussier and
Morgan, 1999; Shinozaki and Furui, 2001) and that
fast speech increases error rates (Siegler and Stern,
1995; Fosler-Lussier and Morgan, 1999; Shinozaki

and Furui, 2001). Siegler and Stern (1995) and
Shinozaki and Furui (2001) also found higher error rates in very slow speech. Word length (in
phones) has also been found to be a useful predictor of higher error rates (Shinozaki and Furui,
2001). In Hirschberg et al.’s (2004) analysis of
two human-computer dialogue systems, misrecognized turns were found to have (on average) higher
maximum pitch and energy than correctly recognized turns. Results for speech rate were ambiguous:
faster utterances had higher error rates in one corpus,
but lower error rates in the other. Finally, AddaDecker and Lamel (2005) demonstrated that both
French and English ASR systems had more trouble
with male speakers than female speakers, and found
several possible explanations, including higher rates
of disﬂuencies and more reduction.
Many questions are left unanswered by these previous studies. In the word-level analyses of FoslerLussier and Morgan (1999) and Shinozaki and Furui (2001), only substitution and deletion errors were
considered, so we do not know how including insertions might affect the results. Moreover, these studies primarily analyzed lexical, rather than prosodic,
factors. Hirschberg et al.’s (2004) work suggests that
prosodic factors can impact error rates, but leaves
open the question of which factors are important at
the word level and how they inﬂuence recognition
of natural conversational speech. Adda-Decker and
Lamel’s (2005) suggestion that higher rates of disﬂuency are a cause of worse recognition for male
speakers presupposes that disﬂuencies raise error
rates. While this assumption seems natural, it has
yet to be carefully tested, and in particular we do not

know whether disﬂuent words are associated with
errors in adjacent words, or are simply more likely to
be misrecognized themselves. Other factors that are
often thought to affect a word’s recognition, such as
its status as a content or function word, and whether
it starts a turn, also remain unexamined.
The present study is designed to address all of
these questions by analyzing the effects of a wide
range of lexical and prosodic factors on the accuracy of an English ASR system for conversational
telephone speech. In the remainder of this paper, we
ﬁrst describe the data set used in our study and introduce a new measure of error, individual word error
rate (IWER), that allows us to include insertion errors in our analysis, along with deletions and substitutions. Next, we present the features we collected
for each word and the effects of those features individually on IWER. Finally, we develop a joint statistical model to examine the effects of each feature
while controlling for possible correlations.

2 Data
For our analysis, we used the output from the
SRI/ICSI/UW RT-04 CTS system (Stolcke et al.,
2006) on the NIST RT-03 development set. This system’s performance was state-of-the-art at the time of
the 2004 evaluation. The data set contains 36 telephone conversations (72 speakers, 38477 reference
words), half from the Fisher corpus and half from
the Switchboard corpus.1
The standard measure of error used in ASR is
word error rate (WER), computed as 100(I + D +
S)/R, where I, D and S are the number of insertions, deletions, and substitutions found by aligning the ASR hypotheses with the reference transcriptions, and R is the number of reference words.
Since we wish to know what features of a reference
word increase the probability of an error, we need
a way to measure the errors attributable to individual words — an individual word error rate (IWER).
We assume that a substitution or deletion error can
be assigned to its corresponding reference word, but
for insertion errors, there may be two adjacent reference words that could be responsible. Our solution is to assign any insertion errors to each of

the adjacent words. We could then deﬁne IWER as
100(ni + nd + ns )/R, where ni , nd , and ns are the
insertion, deletion, and substitution counts for individual words (with nd = D and ns = S). In general,
however, ni > I, so that the IWER for a given data
set would be larger than the WER. To facilitate comparisons with standard WER, we therefore discount
insertions by a factor α, such that αni = I. In this
study, α = .617.

3 Analysis of individual features
3.1

Features

The reference transcriptions used in our analysis
distinguish between ﬁve different types of words:
ﬁlled pauses (um, uh), fragments (wh-, redistr-),
backchannels (uh-huh, mm-hm), guesses (where the
transcribers were unsure of the correct words), and
full words (everything else). Error rates for each
of these types can be found in Table 1. The remainder of our analysis considers only the 36159 invocabulary full words in the reference transcriptions
(70 OOV full words are excluded). We collected the
following features for these words:
Speaker sex Male or female.
Broad syntactic class Open class (e.g., nouns and
verbs), closed class (e.g., prepositions and articles),
or discourse marker (e.g., okay, well). Classes were
identiﬁed using a POS tagger (Ratnaparkhi, 1996)
trained on the tagged Switchboard corpus.
Log probability The unigram log probability of
each word, as listed in the system’s language model.
Word length The length of each word (in phones),
determined using the most frequent pronunciation

found for that word in the recognition lattices.

3.2

Position near disﬂuency A collection of features
indicating whether a word occurred before or after a
ﬁlled pause, fragment, or repeated word; or whether
the word itself was the ﬁrst, last, or other word in a
sequence of repetitions. Figure 1 illustrates. Only
identical repeated words with no intervening words
or ﬁlled pauses were considered repetitions.

Results of our analysis of individual features can be
found in Table 2 (for categorical features) and Figure
2 (for numeric features). Comparing the error rates
for the full-word and the no-contractions data sets in
Table 2 veriﬁes that removing contractions does not
create systematic changes in the patterns of errors,
although it does lower error rates (and signiﬁcance
values) slightly overall. (First and middle repetitions
are combined as non-ﬁnal repetitions in the table,
because only 52 words were middle repetitions, and
their error rates were similar to initial repetitions.)

First word of turn Turn boundaries were assigned
automatically at the beginning of any utterance following a pause of at least 100 ms during which the
other speaker spoke.
Speech rate The average speech rate (in phones per
second) was computed for each utterance using the
pronunciation dictionary extracted from the lattices
and the utterance boundary timestamps in the reference transcriptions.
In addition to the above features, we used Praat
(Boersma and Weenink, 2007) to collect the following additional prosodic features on a subset of the
data obtained by excluding all contractions:2
Pitch The minimum, maximum, mean, and range
of pitch for each word.
Intensity The minimum, maximum, mean, and
range of intensity for each word.
Duration The duration of each word.
31017 words (85.8% of the full-word data set) remain in the no-contractions data set after removing
words for which pitch and/or intensity features could
not be extracted.
2

Contractions were excluded before collecting prosodic features for the following reason. In the reference transcriptions
and alignments used for scoring ASR systems, contractions are
treated as two separate words. However, aside from speech
rate, our prosodic features were collected using word-by-word
timestamps from a forced alignment that used a transcription
where contractions are treated as single words. Thus, the start
and end times for a contraction in the forced alignment correspond to two words in the alignments used for scoring, and it is
not clear how to assign prosodic features appropriately to those
words.

3.2.1

Results and discussion

Disﬂuency features

Perhaps the most interesting result in Table 2 is
that the effects of disﬂuencies are highly variable depending on the type of disﬂuency and the position
of a word relative to it. Non-ﬁnal repetitions and
words next to fragments have an IWER up to 15%
(absolute) higher than the average word, while ﬁnal repetitions and words following repetitions have
an IWER up to 7.2% lower. Words occurring before repetitions or next to ﬁlled pauses do not have
signiﬁcantly different error rates than words not in
those positions. Our results for repetitions support
Shriberg’s (1995) hypothesis that the ﬁnal word of a
repeated sequence is in fact ﬂuent.
3.2.2

Other categorical features

Our results support the common wisdom that
open class words have lower error rates than other
words (although the effect we ﬁnd is small), and that
words at the start of a turn have higher error rates.
Also, like Adda-Decker and Lamel (2005), we ﬁnd
that male speakers have higher error rates than females, though in our data set the difference is more
striking (3.6% absolute, compared to their 2.0%).
3.2.3

Word probability and word length

Turning to Figure 2, we ﬁnd (consistent with previous results) that low-probability words have dramatically higher error rates than high-probability

using 10,000 samples in a Monte Carlo permutation test) are in bold (p < .05) or bold italics (p < .005). Features

words. More surprising is that word length in
phones does not seem to have a consistent effect on
IWER. Further analysis reveals a possible explanation: word length is correlated with duration, but
anti-correlated to the same degree with log probability (the Kendall τ statistics are .50 and -.49). Figure 2 shows that words with longer duration have
lower IWER. Since words with more phones tend to
have longer duration, but lower frequency, there is
no overall effect of length.
3.2.4

Prosodic features

Figure 2 shows that means of pitch and intensity
have relatively little effect except at extreme values, where more errors occur. In contrast, pitch
and intensity range show clear linear trends, with
greater range of pitch or intensity leading to lower
IWER.3 As noted above, decreased duration is associated with increased IWER, and (as in previous
work), we ﬁnd that IWER increases dramatically
for fast speech. We also see a tendency towards
higher IWER for very slow speech, consistent with
Shinozaki and Furui (2001) and Siegler and Stern
(1995). The effects of pitch minimum and maximum
are not shown for reasons of space, but are similar
to pitch mean. Also not shown are intensity minimum (with more errors at higher values) and intensity maximum (with more errors at lower values).
For most of our prosodic features, as well as log
probability, extreme values seem to be associated

Our decision to use the log transform of pitch range was
originally based on the distribution of pitch range values in the
data set. Exploratory data analysis also indicated that using the
transformed values would likely lead to a better model ﬁt (Section 4) than using the raw values.

with worse recognition than average values. We explore this possibility further in Section 4.

4 Analysis using a joint model
In the previous section, we investigated the effects
of various individual features on ASR error rates.
However, there are many correlations between these
features – for example, words with longer duration
are likely to have a larger range of pitch and intensity. In this section, we build a single model with all
of our features as potential predictors in order to determine the effects of each feature after controlling
for the others. We use the no-contractions data set so
that we can include prosodic features in our model.
Since only 1% of tokens have an IWER > 1, we
simplify modeling by predicting only whether each
token is responsible for an error or not. That is, our
dependent variable is binary, taking on the value 1 if
IWER > 0 for a given token and 0 otherwise.
4.1

Model

To model data with a binary dependent variable, a
logistic regression model is an appropriate choice.
In logistic regression, we model the log odds as a
linear combination of feature values x0 . . . xn :
p
log
= β0 x0 + β1 x1 + . . . + βn xn
1−p
where p is the probability that the outcome occurs
(here, that a word is misrecognized) and β0 . . . βn
are coefﬁcients (feature weights) to be estimated.
Standard logistic regression models assume that all
categorical features are ﬁxed effects, meaning that
all possible values for these features are known in
advance, and each value may have an arbitrarily different effect on the outcome. However, features

such as speaker identity do not ﬁt this pattern. Instead, we control for speaker differences by assuming that speaker identity is a random effect, meaning that the speakers observed in the data are a random sample from a larger population. The baseline probability of error for each speaker is therefore
assumed to be a normally distributed random variable, with mean equal to the population mean, and
variance to be estimated by the model. Stated differently, a random effect allows us to add a factor
to the model for speaker identity, without allowing
arbitrary variation in error rates between speakers.
Models such as ours, with both ﬁxed and random
effects, are known as mixed-effects models, and are
becoming a standard method for analyzing linguistic data (Baayen, 2008). We ﬁt our models using the
lme4 package (Bates, 2007) of R (R Development
Core Team, 2007).
To analyze the joint effects of all of our features,
we initially built as large a model as possible, and
used backwards elimination to remove features one
at a time whose presence did not contribute signiﬁcantly (at p ≤ .05) to model ﬁt. All of the features
shown in Table 2 were converted to binary variables
and included as predictors in our initial model, along
with a binary feature controlling for corpus (Fisher
or Switchboard), and all numeric features in Figure
2. We did not include minimum and maximum values for pitch and intensity because they are highly

correlated with the mean values, making parameter
estimation in the combined model difﬁcult. Preliminary investigation indicated that using the mean values would lead to the best overall ﬁt to the data.
In addition to these basic ﬁxed effects, our initial model included quadratic terms for all of the numeric features, as suggested by our analysis in Section 3, as well as random effects for speaker identity and word identity. All numeric features were
rescaled to values between 0 and 1 so that coefﬁcients are comparable.
4.2

Results and discussion

Figure 3 shows the estimated coefﬁcients and standard errors for each of the ﬁxed effect categorical
features remaining in the reduced model (i.e., after
backwards elimination). Since all of the features are
binary, a coefﬁcient of β indicates that the corresponding feature, when present, adds a weight of β
to the log odds (i.e., multiplies the odds of an error
by a factor of eβ ). Thus, features with positive coefﬁcients increase the odds of an error, and features
with negative coefﬁcients decrease the odds of an error. The magnitude of the coefﬁcient corresponds to
the size of the effect.
Interpreting the coefﬁcients for our numeric features is less intuitive, since most of these variables
have both linear and quadratic effects. The contribution to the log odds of a particular numeric feature

negative y values indicate decreased odds of an error. The x axes in these plots reﬂect the rescaled
values of each feature, so that 0 corresponds to the
minimum value in the data set, and 1 to the maximum value.
4.2.1 Disﬂuencies
In our analysis of individual features, we found
that different types of disﬂuencies have different effects: non-ﬁnal repeated words and words near fragments have higher error rates, while ﬁnal repetitions
and words following repetitions have lower error
rates. After controlling for other factors, a different picture emerges. There is no longer an effect for
ﬁnal repetitions or words after repetitions; all other
disﬂuency features increase the odds of an error by
a factor of 1.3 to 2.9. These differences from Section 3 can be explained by noting that words near
ﬁlled pauses and repetitions have longer durations
than other words (Bell et al., 2003). Longer duration
lowers IWER, so controlling for duration reveals the
negative effect of the nearby disﬂuencies. Our results are also consistent with Shriberg’s (1995) ﬁndings on ﬂuency in repeated words, since ﬁnal repetitions have no signiﬁcant effect in our combined
model, while non-ﬁnal repetitions incur a penalty.
4.2.2 Other categorical features
Without controlling for other lexical or prosodic
features, we found that a word is more likely to
be misrecognized at the beginning of a turn, and
less likely to be misrecognized if it is an open class
word. According to our joint model, these effects
still hold even after controlling for other features.

Similarly, male speakers still have higher error rates
than females. This last result sheds some light on
the work of Adda-Decker and Lamel (2005), who
suggested several factors that could explain males’
higher error rates. In particular, they showed that
males have higher rates of disﬂuency, produce words
with slightly shorter durations, and use more alternate (“sloppy”) pronunciations. Our joint model
controls for the ﬁrst two of these factors, suggesting
that the third factor or some other explanation must
account for the remaining differences between males
and females. One possibility is that female speech is
more easily recognized because females tend to have
expanded vowel spaces (Diehl et al., 1996), a factor
that is associated with greater intelligibility (Bradlow et al., 1996) and is characteristic of genres with
lower ASR error rates (Nakamura et al., 2008).
4.2.3

Prosodic features

Examining the effects of pitch and intensity individually, we found that increased range for these features is associated with lower IWER, while higher
pitch and extremes of intensity are associated with
higher IWER. In the joint model, we see the same
effect of pitch mean and an even stronger effect for
intensity, with the predicted odds of an error dramatically higher for extreme intensity values. Meanwhile, we no longer see a beneﬁt for increased pitch
range and intensity; rather, we see small quadratic
effects for both features, i.e. words with average
ranges of pitch and intensity are recognized more
easily than words with extreme values for these features. As with disﬂuencies, we hypothesize that the
linear trends observed in Section 3 are primarily due
to effects of duration, since duration is moderately
correlated with both log pitch range (τ = .35) and
intensity range (τ = .41).
Our ﬁnal two prosodic features, duration and
speech rate, showed strong linear and weak
quadratic trends when analyzed individually. According to our model, both duration and speech rate
are still important predictors of error after controlling for other features. However, as with the other
prosodic features, predictions of the joint model are
dominated by quadratic trends, i.e., predicted error
rates are lower for average values of duration and
speech rate than for extreme values.
Overall, the results from our joint analysis suggest

that, after controlling for other factors, extreme values for prosodic features are associated with worse
recognition than typical values.
4.2.4 Differences between lexical items
As discussed above, our model contains a random
effect for word identity, to control for the possibility that certain lexical items have higher error rates
that are not explained by any of the other factors
in the model. It is worth asking whether this random effect is really necessary. To address this question, we compared the ﬁt to the data of two models,
each containing all of our ﬁxed effects and a random effect for speaker identity. One model also contained a random effect for word identity. Results are
shown in Table 3. The model without a random effect for word identity is signiﬁcantly worse than the

full model; in fact, this single parameter is more important than all of the lexical features combined. To
see which lexical items are causing the most difﬁculty, we examined the items with the highest estimated increases in error. The top 20 items on this
list include yup, yep, yes, buy, then, than, and r., all
of which are acoustically similar to each other or to
other high-frequency words, as well as the words after, since, now, and though, which occur in many
syntactic contexts, making them difﬁcult to predict
based on the language model.
4.2.5

Differences between speakers

We examined the importance of the random effect
for speaker identity in a similar fashion to the effect for word identity. As shown in Table 3, speaker
identity is a very important factor in determining the
probability of error. That is, the lexical and prosodic
variables examined here are not sufﬁcient to fully
explain the differences in error rates between speakers. In fact, the speaker effect is the single most important factor in the model.
Given that the differences in error rates between
speakers are so large (average IWER for different
speakers ranges from 5% to 51%), we wondered
whether our model is sufﬁcient to capture the kinds
of speaker variation that exist. The model assumes
that each speaker has a different baseline error rate,
but that the effects of each variable are the same for
each speaker. Determining the extent to which this
assumption is justiﬁed is beyond the scope of this
paper, however we present some suggestive results
in Figure 5. This ﬁgure illustrates some of the dif-

Figure 5: Estimated effects of various features on the error rates of two different speakers (top and bottom). Dashed
lines illustrate the baseline probability of error for each speaker. Solid lines were obtained by ﬁtting a logistic regression model to each speaker’s data, with the variable labeled on the x-axis as the only predictor.

ferences between two speakers chosen fairly arbitrarily from our data set. Not only are the baseline
error rates different for the two speakers, but the effects of various features appear to be very different,
in one case even reversed. The rest of our data set
exhibits similar kinds of variability for many of the
features we examined. These differences in ASR behavior between speakers are particularly interesting
considering that the system we investigated here already incorporates speaker adaptation models.

5 Conclusion
In this paper, we introduced the individual word error rate (IWER) for measuring ASR performance
on individual words, including insertions as well as
deletions and substitutions. Using IWER, we analyzed the effects of various word-level lexical and
prosodic features, both individually and in a joint
model. Our analysis revealed the following effects.
(1) Words at the start of a turn have slightly higher
IWER than average, and open class (content) words
have slightly lower IWER. These effects persist even
after controlling for other lexical and prosodic factors. (2) Disﬂuencies heavily impact error rates:
IWER for non-ﬁnal repetitions and words adjacent
to fragments rises by up to 15% absolute, while
IWER for ﬁnal repetitions and words following repetitions decreases by up to 7.2% absolute. Controlling for prosodic features eliminates the latter beneﬁt, and reveals a negative effect of adjacent ﬁlled
pauses, suggesting that the effects of these disﬂuen-

cies are normally obscured by the greater duration of
nearby words. (3) For most acoustic-prosodic features, words with extreme values have worse recognition than words with average values. This effect
becomes much more pronounced after controlling
for other factors. (4) After controlling for lexical
and prosodic characteristics, the lexical items with
the highest error rates are primarily homophones or
near-homophones (e.g., buy vs. by, then vs. than).
(5) Speaker differences account for much of the variance in error rates between words. Moreover, the direction and strength of effects of different prosodic
features may vary between speakers.
While we plan to extend our analysis to other
ASR systems in order to determine the generality
of our ﬁndings, we have already gained important
insights into a number of factors that increase ASR
error rates. In addition, our results suggest a rich
area for future research in further analyzing the variability of both lexical and prosodic effects on ASR
behavior for different speakers.
