Introduction

Grammatical theory has long wrestled with the fact that causative constructions exhibit
properties of both single words and complex phrases. However, as Paul Kiparsky has observed, the distribution of such properties of causatives is not arbitrary: ‘construal’ phenomena such as honoriﬁcation, anaphor and pronominal binding, and quantiﬁer ‘ﬂoating’
typically behave as they would if causatives were syntactically complex, embedding constructions; whereas case marking, agreement and word order phenomena all point to the
analysis of causatives as single lexical items.1
Although an analysis of causatives in terms of complex syntactic structures has frequently
been adopted in an attempt to simplify the mapping to semantic structure, we believe
that motivating syntactic structure based on perceived semantics is questionable because in
general a syntax/semantics homomorphism cannot be maintained without vitiating syntactic
theory (Miller 1991). Instead, we sketch a strictly lexical theory of Japanese causatives that
deals with the evidence oﬀered for a complex phrasal analysis. Such an analysis makes the
phonology, morphology and syntax parallel, while a mismatch occurs with the semantics.
The conclusions we will reach are given in (1):
(1) a. Japanese causatives must be treated as single verbal forms with complex morphological structure. The causative morpheme should not be treated as a higher predicate
as it is in most transformational/GB analyses (following Kuroda (1965)), and in
Gunji (this volume).
1

This paper has had a long gestation. Initial arguments for a lexicalist treatment of Japanese causatives
were gathered in a seminar class run by Ivan Sag in 1990. Participants included Makoto Kanazawa, Patrick
O’Neill, and Whitney Tabor. The details of the analysis were changed and a new paper written by the
listed authors and O’Neill for presentation at the 1994 LSA Annual Meeting in Boston. The present version,
which includes new data and extensive analytic revisions, was prepared by Manning and Sag, in regular
consultation with Iida. We thank earlier contributors, and in addition are grateful to the following for
comments and discussion: Emily Bender, Gosse Bouma, Ann Copestake, Kaz Fukushima, Takao Gunji,
Rob Malouf, Tsuneko Nakazawa, Jerry Sadock, and Peter Sells. We’re not quite sure who should be held
responsible for any remaining errors.

b. The construal phenomena that seem to motivate an analysis of Japanese causatives
in terms of embedded constituent structures can be explained in terms of hierarchical
lexical argument structures.
c. It is possible to maintain a strictly lexical analysis, once a suitable conception of
lexical structure and organization is adopted.
Our analysis, which provides a simple alternative to current proposals making extensive use
of verb-embedding, functional projections and empty categories, is cast within the framework
of Head-driven Phrase Structure Grammar (HPSG), but is easily adapted to other lexical
frameworks, such as LFG and Categorial Grammar, and is similar in some respects to lexical
GB accounts like those oﬀered by Miyagawa (1980) and Kitagawa (1986).

The Data

Japanese causative verbs are formed by adding -(s)ase to a verb stem, as in (2). The causer
is marked with the nominative case particle ga, and the causee is marked with the dative
particle ni (or optionally the accusative particle o if the stem was intransitive).
(2) Yumiko ga Ziroo ni sono hon o
yom-ase-ta.
Yumiko nom Ziroo dat that book acc read-caus-past
‘Yumiko made/let Ziroo read that book.’

2.1

Phonological and Lexical Arguments

The intuition of the native Japanese speaker regarding the “wordhood” of a causative verb
such as tazune-sase-ru ‘visit-caus-pres’ is clear – these verbs are single words. This intuition is supported by a number of phonological observations that have been made by
Kitagawa (1986), McCawley (1968), Poser (1984), and others. We present here arguments
from allomorphy and reduplication, and suggestive evidence from accentuation (for similar
suggestive evidence from voicing spread and downdrift see Kitagawa (1986)).
2.1.1

Allomorphy

The consonant deletion giving -sase → -ase after consonant stems:
(3) a. tabe -sase -ru
eat -caus -pres
b. kak -ase -ru
write -caus -pres
is idiosyncratic rather than a general phonological rule (the general phonological rules would
rather yield epenthesis, i.e., kakisaseru). This argues that -sase is lexically attached.

2

2.1.2

Reduplication

Repetition of a certain action can be expressed by reduplicating the verb (4a). Such reduplication with causatives cannot exclude the verb stem (4c):
(4) a. gohan o
tabe tabe
rice acc eat eat
‘eating rice repeatedly’
b. ?gohan o
tabe-sase tabe-sase
rice
acc eat-caus eat-caus
‘causing someone to eat rice repeatedly’
c. *gohan o
tabe-sase sase
rice
acc eat-caus caus
This argues that tabe-sase must be formed in the lexicon, since reduplication is a lexical
process (Marantz 1982).2
2.1.3

Accentuation

Kitagawa (1986) presents a number of further arguments based on the theory of Lexical
Phonology (Kiparsky 1982) that show that the past tense morpheme -ta and the desiderative
morpheme -ta(i) attach to their host in the lexicon. This host can be either a verb root or
the causative morpheme (among other things). For instance, observe the following pattern
of accentuation (McCawley 1968, Chew 1961):
(5) a. tab´-ru (eat-pres)
e
b. t´be-ta (eat-past)
a
c. tabe-sas´-ru (eat-caus-pres)
e
d. tabe-s´se-ta (eat-caus-past)
a
Miyagawa (1989) and Kitagawa (1986) argue that under the theory of Lexical Phonology,
these accentual alternations show that the past tense morpheme attaches lexically. On the
assumption that the causative morpheme attaches to a verb stem before the ﬁnal tense morpheme, then this evidence would show that the causative morpheme also attaches lexically.
However, we do not view such arguments as deciding the structure of causatives. One could
accept the lexical attachment of the tense and desiderative morphemes and still deny the
additional assumption mentioned above. We do not know of further convincing phonological
evidence for the lexical analysis of Japanese causatives beyond that presented in Sections
2.1.1 and 2.1.2.3
2

The awkwardness of (4b) is presumably due to pragmatic factors.
Other putative arguments, like noting that the accent on -m´su overrides a stem aﬃx across a causative
a
aﬃx, also fail because the same accentual phenomena occur with verbal compounds like yonde miru. Poser
(class, Stanford, 1993) suggests as a further argument that normally any word can be an intonational minor
phrase (with focus intonation) in the sense of McCawley (1968) but that -sase cannot be one. We thank Bill
Poser for discussion of the phonological data.

2.1.4

Lexicalization, idioms, and blocking

Miyagawa (1980, 1989) presents a variety of arguments from idioms, blocking, and idiosyncratic causatives (that have undergone semantic drift or which have survived while the base
verb has disappeared) to argue for a lexical analysis of Japanese causatives. We take many
of these arguments as suggestive, but not fully convincing, because there are clear cases in
the literature where blocking and semantic drift occur in the syntax (e.g., Poser (1992)).

2.2

Morphosyntactic Arguments

A large number of morphosyntactic arguments favor the lexical analysis.
2.2.1

Subject Honoriﬁcation

When the person denoted by the subject NP is socially superior to the speaker, the verb
that governs that subject conventionally bears subject honoriﬁcation morphology, o- and ni
nar-, as illustrated in (6a), which involves the syntactically complex -te yaru construction.4
Only the main verb can bear subject honoriﬁcation morphology in such constructions, as
shown by the ungrammaticality of (6b).
(6) a. Tanaka-sensei ga kodomo ni hon o
yonde
o-yari
ni nat-ta.
Prof. Tanaka nom child
dat book acc read-ger hon-give become-past
‘Prof. Tanaka gave the child the favor of reading a book.’
b.*Tanaka-sensei ga kodomo ni hon o
o-yonde
yari ni nat-ta.
Prof. Tanaka nom child
dat book acc hon-read-ger give become-past
‘Prof. Tanaka gave the child the favor of reading the book.’
In contrast, a causative verb as a whole can bear subject honoriﬁcation morphology, whereas
the causative morpheme -(s)ase alone cannot bear that morphology, as shown in (7):
(7) a. Tanaka-sensei ga Suzuki ni hon o
o-yom-ase
ni nat-ta.
Prof. Tanaka nom Suzuki dat book acc hon-read-caus become-past
‘Prof. Tanaka made Suzuki read a book.’
b.*Tanaka-sensei ga Suzuki ni hon o
yomi o-sase
ni nat-ta.
Prof. Tanaka nom Suzuki dat book acc read hon-caus become-past
‘Prof. Tanaka made Suzuki read a book.’
This observation argues for a lexical analysis of the causative (Sugioka 1984:51). If the construction were syntactically complex, the honoriﬁc preﬁx should precede only the causative
morpheme, in parallel to (6a). Put diﬀerently, in an analysis where causatives involve embedded complement clauses, it is quite mysterious how the honoriﬁc preﬁx o- gets to attach
to the verb in the lower clause.
4

We don’t gloss the word ni which appears in the subject honoriﬁc construction because we are not
sure what it is. Accentuation suggests that yari is a deverbal noun, though it could conceivably be the
segmentally identical verbal renyookei. It is reasonably certain, though, that the morpheme o- before yari
is a preﬁx attached to the word yari.

4

Note ﬁnally that the other possibility, where honoriﬁcation occurs inside causativization
in the morphology, as in (8), provides no problems for a lexical account. For such a form,
honoriﬁcation occurs to the stem, and then this larger stem is causativized. The resulting
pattern whereby the causee is honored falls out of the account we present below, and would
be expected to fall out of almost any lexical account.5
(8) Syukutyoku no yoomuin ga kootyoo-sensei ni yoomuin-situ
de
night.duty gen janitor nom principal
dat night.duty.room in
sibaraku o-yasumi ni nar-ase-te
sasiage-ta (koto)
a.little hon-rest
become-caus-ger give-past (fact)
‘The janitor on night duty let the principal take a rest in the night duty room for a
little while.’
2.2.2

The Double-O Constraint

Example (9) shows that the causative construction observes the double-o constraint (a prohibition on multiple direct objects, marked by the particle o: see Harada (1973), Poser (1989)).
When the embedded verb is transitive, the causee cannot be marked with accusative because
this would yield two o-marked NPs.
(9) Taroo ga Ziroo *o/ni
Kazuo o
home-sase-ta.
Taro nom Ziro acc/dat Kazuo acc praise-caus-past
‘Taro made Ziro praise Kazuo.’
The case marking in the morphological causative thus parallels that of the lexical causative
(10a) and that of simplex three-argument verbs (10b):
(10) a. Taroo ga Ziroo *o/ni
e
o
mise-ta.
Taro nom Ziro acc/dat picture acc show-past
‘Taroo showed a picture to Ziroo.’
b. Taroo ga Ziroo *o/ni
e
o
age-ta.
Taro nom Ziro acc/dat picture acc give-past
‘Taroo gave a picture to Ziroo.’
Only the lexical analysis predicts the case marking of causatives from the general case marking requirements for three-argument verbs without a further stipulation.
2.2.3

Nominalization

Nominalizations also support the lexical approach. Suﬃxation of -kata creates a nominal
meaning ‘way of’, and can apply to causatives (Saiki 1987), as illustrated in (11b).
(11) a. kodomo ni hon o
yom-ase-ta.
child
dat book acc read-caus-past
‘(I) caused the child to read a book.’
5

Such forms are often pragmatically awkward, however, doubtless due to the incongruity of simultaneously
honoring someone and making them the causee.

5

b. (?kodomo e
no) hon no yom-ase-kata
child
dat gen book gen read-caus-way
‘the way to cause (the child) to read a book’
The genitive case-marking on the object hon shows that yomasekata is a noun. Under a
nonlexical analysis of causatives we would expect to nominalize only -(s)ase and to get
accusative case o after hon. Moreover, it would be diﬃcult to account for the accent deleting properties of -kata, within a theory such as Lexical Phonology, unless yom-ase-kata is
analyzed as a single word.6
2.2.4

Question-answer pairs

A question with biclausal structure in Japanese is generally answered by repetition of the
higher verb:
(12) a. John ga iku
yoo ni si-ta
ka?
John nom go-pres (comp) do-past Q
‘Have (you) arranged for John to go?’
b. Si-ta (yo).
do-past
‘Yes, I have.’ lit. ‘Did.’
(13) a. John ni [it-te
kure-ru yoo ni] tanon-da ka?
John dat [go-ger give-pres (comp)] ask-past Q
‘Have (you) asked John to go?’
b. Tanon-da (yo).
ask-past
‘Yes, I have.’ lit. ‘Asked.’
But one cannot answer a question formed with a causative construction by just a causative
morpheme. Rather one must repeat the whole causative form (i.e. including the putative
embedded verb):
(14) a. John o
ik-ase-ta
ka?
John acc go-caus-past Q
‘Have you cause John to go?’
b.*Sase-ta.
caus-past
This behavior requires a special stipulation on the nonlexical account. It is predicted if the
causativized verb is treated as a lexical item.
6

We thank Peter Sells and Bill Poser for most of the ideas that underlie this section. It should be
mentioned, though, that this argument only shows that the noun yomasekata is a word, and not necessarily
that the corresponding verbal forms are, as was pointed out to us by a reviewer.

6

2.2.5

Word Order

When a causative verb takes a theme argument and a location argument, the unmarked
order is location-theme, not theme-location. For instance, in a pair like:
(15) a. no ni hana o
sak-ase-ru
ﬁeld in ﬂower acc bloom-caus-pres
‘to cause ﬂowers to bloom in ﬁelds’
b. hana o
no ni sak-ase-ru
ﬂower acc ﬁeld in bloom-caus-pres
‘to cause ﬂowers to bloom in ﬁelds’
the ﬁrst sentence, which has the location-theme order, is unmarked. The second sentence
is somewhat less natural, and seems to be acceptable only when the location argument gets
focus interpretation. This observation is unexpected under the nonlexical analysis, because
it predicts that the causee argument (here, the theme) should precede all the embedded
arguments in the unmarked word order, assuming that the order produced by clausal embedding is the unmarked order. In contrast, this unmarked ordering is predicted under a
lexical account where it reﬂects the normal rules for ordering clausal constituents (Kuno
1973:351).
2.2.6

Potential

Japanese has a morpheme, -(rar)e which adds a notion of ability or possibility to the meaning
of a verb. When this morpheme is introduced into a clause, an argument which was marked
in the accusative may optionally be marked with the nominative:
(16) a. Mitiko wa hon o
yon-da
Mitiko top book acc read-past
‘Mitiko read the book.’
b. Mitiko wa hon ga/o
yom-e-ru
Mitiko top book nom/acc read-pot-pres
‘Mitiko can read the book.’
This generalization applies even to potentialized causatives (although the resulting sentences
are somewhat less natural):
(17)?Taroo ga kodomo ni piano ga naraw-ase-rare-nakat-ta
(koto)
Taroo nom child
dat piano nom learn-caus-pot-neg-past (fact)
‘(the fact that) Taroo was not able to make the child learn how to play the piano.’
This fact would lack any natural explanation on a nonlexical analysis which treats the
third NP in (17) as belonging to an embedded clause. But it follows naturally on the
lexical analysis: the third NP is treated as an argument of the potentialized verb, so its
case-marking is predicted by the same generalization that speciﬁes the case marking for
potentialized simplex verbs, such as in (16b).
7

2.2.7

Negative polarity items and reciprocals

It is generally accepted that the negative polarity item sika ‘except’ can only be licensed by
a negative in its own clause (Muraki 1978, Kitagawa 1986:136).7 For instance, the following
is impossible:
(18)*Watasi wa [kare ga biiru sika nom-u]
to
sir-ana-katta.
I
top he nom beer except drink-pres comp know-neg-past
*‘I didn’t know that he drinks anything but beer.’
But note now that sika is licensed on an argument of the verb stem in a causative, even
though the sentential negation occurs after (s)ase-:
(19) ano ban watasi wa Taroo ni biiru sika nom-ase-na-katta.
that night I
top Taroo dat beer except drink-caus-neg-past
‘That night, I made/let Taroo drink only beer.’ lit. ‘. . . not drink except beer.’
This argues that a causative sentence is a single clause. Similar arguments can be made
with respect to the reciprocal morpheme -a(w): see Kitagawa (1986:174), although, as noted
there, there is considerable variation in the acceptance of reciprocalized causatives.

2.3

Syntactic Puzzles for a Lexical Analysis

Now let us turn to syntactic arguments, which are often taken to favor a non-lexical analysis.
We will show that all relevant data can in fact be satisfactorily explained within the lexical
analysis we develop. We begin with what we take to be two non-arguments, and then consider
in turn data from adverb scope, apparent coordination, binding, and quantiﬁer scope.
2.3.1

Non-arguments from anaphora and intervening particles

Shibatani (1973) argues for a nonlexical analysis on the grounds that the putative pro-VP soo
s- ‘do so’ may refer to either a whole causation event or the lower predicate. However, many
people have expressed skepticism as to whether soo s- is a pro-VP (Hinds 1973, Miyagawa
1980). It is not the case that soo s- always takes a VP antecedent, since the antecedent can
be an event expressed by two conjoined sentences in a previous discourse:
(20) A: Taroo wa Yamada-sensei ni ai
ni
it-ta.
Taroo top Yamada-teacher dat meet purp go-past
‘Taroo went to see Prof. Yamada.’
Suisenzyoo
o
kaite morau yoo tanon-da.
recommendation acc write receive comp ask-past
‘He asked for a letter of recommendation to be written for him.’
B: Hanako mo soo si-ta.
Hanako also so do-past
‘Hanako did so, too.’
7

Sika cooccurs with a negative verb as an NPI. It is generally translated as ‘only’ in English in a positive
sentence.

8

This suggests that the antecedent of soo suru might better be described in terms of the
cognitive structure of events than via syntactic notions of constituency.
Kuroda (1981) argues for a syntactic analysis of causatives on the basis of the ability of
the negative morpheme na- and certain particles such as mo ‘also’ and sae ‘even’ to intervene
between a verb stem and what he takes to be a bare causative morpheme. However, any
such argument is greatly weakened by the homonymy between the causative sase- and the
form that results from adding (s)ase- to the verb stem s- ‘do’: s- + (s)ase- → s-ase. See
Miyagawa (1989) and particularly Kitagawa (1986:184) for evidence establishing that the
allegedly problematic examples are actually manifestations of the causative of s- ‘do’.
2.3.2

Adverb Scope

Next, we consider adverb scope. Adverbs in the causative construction can in general be
interpreted as modifying either the event denoted by the verb stem or the causation event
(Shibatani 1990:314). For instance, (21) is ambiguous.
(21) Noriko ga Masaru ni gakkoo de hasir-ase-ta.
Noriko nom Masaru dat school at run-caus-past
‘Noriko made Masaru run at school.’
What happened at school may be either the causing event performed by Noriko or the
running event caused by Noriko and performed by Masaru.
If adverb scope could be captured only by providing phrase structural domains for an
adverb to take scope over, then this would be an argument for a syntactic analysis. Diﬀerent
interpretations could be obtained by assuming diﬀerent positions for the adverb as illustrated
in (22).
(22) a. [Noriko ga Masaru ni [gakkoo de [[hasir]-ase]]]
b. [Noriko ga Masaru ni [[gakkoo de [hasir]]-ase]]
On this view, the ambiguity of adverb scope is attributed to the presence of an embedding
structure, i.e., the presence of two sentential domains over which adverbs can take scope.
Some authors have suggested that, as a result, certain adverb positions have unambiguous
scope readings, as shown in (23).
(23) a. Taroo ga damatte Hanako o
heya ni hair-ase-ta.
Taroo nom silently Hanako acc room into enter-caus-past
‘Taroo made Hanako enter the room silently.’ [unambiguous] (Miyagawa 1980)
b. Damatte Taroo ga Hanako o
heya ni hair-ase-ta.
Silently Taroo nom Hanako acc room into enter-caus-past
‘Taroo made Hanako enter the room silently.’ [unambiguous] (Miyagawa 1980)
While a full account of diﬀerent scope preferences for adverbs is beyond the scope of this
paper, we note that various proposed structural restrictions on scope have been contested
(e.g., by Kitagawa (1986:89)), and in particular there exist sentences such as those in (24)
9

in which the adverb appears in structurally the same position as in (23a), but where it can
clearly modify either the causation event or the caused event. We will take it as our goal to
allow both scopal possibilities for all adverb positions within the clause.
(24) a. Ken ga hitori de Naomi ni hon o
yom-ase-ta.
Ken nom by oneself Naomi dat book acc read-caus-past
‘Ken made Naomi read the book by herself.’
‘Ken made Naomi read the book all by himself.’
b. Ken ga damatte Naomi o
suwar-ase-ta.
Ken nom silently Naomi acc sit-caus-past
‘Ken (silently) made Naomi sit (silently).’
c. Ken ga zibun no pen de Naomi ni sakubun
o
kak-ase-ta.
Ken nom self gen pen with Naomi dat composition acc write-caus-past
‘Ken (with his own pen) made Naomi write a composition (with her own pen).’
2.3.3

Coordination

It is sometimes assumed that examples like (25) involve coordinate structures, even though
there is no overt coordinating particle.
(25) Ken wa Naomi ni [[hurui kutu o
sute]-te
Ken top Naomi dat old
shoes acc throw-ger
[atarasii kutu o
kaw]] -ase-ta.
new
shoes acc buy caus-past
‘Ken made Naomi throw away her old shoes and buy new ones.’
Given this assumption, the intended reading suggests, as noted by Gunji (1987), that the
VPs hurui kutu o sute and atarasii kutu o kaw are conjoined and -sase is attached to this
complex VP.
These sentences, however, cannot provide strong evidence for any nonlexical analysis
because the phrases containing a gerundive verb (sutete) should be considered as adverbial
phrases, rather than as conjoined VPs.8 Sentence (26) shows that the phrase ‘throw away
old shoes’ is indeed acting as an AdvP because, as an adjunct, it can be placed inside the
middle of the other supposed conjunct.9
(26) Ken wa Naomi ni atarasii kutu o
[hurui kutu o
sute-te] kaw-ase-ta.
Ken top Naomi dat new
shoes acc old
shoes acc throw buy-caus-past
‘Ken made Naomi throw away old shoes and buy new shoes.’
Asymmetries in the desiderative ga/o alternation with these putative “coordinated VPs”,
as in (27), provide further support for our claim (Sugioka 1984:168).
8

We thank Michio Isoda for some of the ideas behind this section.
Some speakers appear to rate this sentence as deserving a ‘?’ in front, while others regard it as ﬁne. At
any rate, this situation contrasts clearly with real conjunction.
9

10

(27) a.*Boku wa [kootya ga non-de], [keeki ga tabe]-tai.
I
top tea
nom drink-ger cake nom eat-desire
‘I want to drink tea and eat cake.’
b.*Boku wa [kootya ga non-de], [keeki o
tabe]-tai.
I
top tea
nom drink-ger cake acc eat-desire
c.?Boku wa [kootya o
non-de], [keeki ga tabe]-tai.
I
top tea
acc drink-ger cake nom eat-desire
d. Boku wa [kootya o
non-de], [keeki o
tabe]-tai.
I
top tea
acc drink-ger cake acc eat-desire
These asymmetries can be explained by assuming that the ﬁrst apparent VP is actually an
AdvP, and that therefore the case marking of the ﬁrst object (kootya ‘tea’) cannot be aﬀected
by properties of the suﬃx -tai.
Thirdly, note the behavior of relativization:
(28) a. [Ken ga Naomi ni [hurui kutu o
sute-te] kaw-ase-ta]
atarasii kutu
Ken nom Naomi dat old
shoes acc throw buy-caus-past new
shoes
‘the new shoes which Ken made Naomi throw away old shoes and buy’
b.*[Ken ga Naomi ni [sute-te] atarasii kutu o
kaw-ase-ta]
hurui kutu
Ken nom Naomi dat throw new
shoes acc buy-caus-past old shoes
‘*the old shoes which Ken made Naomi throw away and buy new ones’
The linearly second object (“new shoes”) can be relativized as in (28a), while the ﬁrst object
(“old shoes”) cannot (28b). If (28a) were actually a case of coordination, then it should be
bad as a violation of the Coordinate Structure Constraint.
We hasten to add that the same asymmetries are found with renyookei “coordination”
as well. The desiderative alternation is illustrated in Sugioka (1984:168), and the same
relativization facts hold as above. Our consultants judge scrambling with renyookei “coordination” less acceptable than with -te form “coordination”, but not impossible. We have
no explanation for this at present.
2.3.4

Binding

Binding facts are used as further syntactic evidence to support a non-lexical analysis (Kuroda
1965). It has been widely accepted in the literature that zibun (‘self’) is a subject-oriented
reﬂexive. The fact that causee arguments can antecede reﬂexives as shown in (29) appears to
support the embedding-structure analysis of causatives: zibun-binding to the causee Taroo
is possible because Taroo is the embedded complement subject.
(29) Hanako ga Taroo ni zibun no syasin o
mi-sase-ta.
Hanako nom Taroo dat self gen picture acc see-caus-past
‘Hanakoi made Tarooj see heri /hisj picture.’

11

In contrast, the standard judgement is that there is no ambiguity in (30) where the lexical
causative form miseru (‘show’) is used.10
(30) Hanako ga Taroo ni zibun no syasin o
mise-ta.
Hanako nom aro dat self gen picture acc show-past
‘Hanako showed Taroo her/*his picture.’
However, as Iida (1992, 1996) has shown, there are good reasons to question the subjectbased account of zibun-binding. There are many clear counterexamples such as those in
(31):
(31) a. Zibun no buka
no husimatu ga Taroo no syusse
o
samatage-ta.
self gen subordinate gen misconduct nom Taroo nom promotion acc mar-past
‘The misconduct of hisi subordinate marred Tarooi ’s promotion.’
b. Taroo wa Zirooi ni zibuni no ayamati o
satosi-ta.
Taroo nom Ziroo dat self
gen mistake acc make-realize-past
‘Taroo made Zirooi realize hisi mistake.’
But even assuming the subject-based generalization is basically right, it is possible to account
for the zibun-binding facts without assuming an embedded constituent structure. Within
HPSG, binding theory is universally based on argument structure, and hence the subjectorientation of zibun-binding need not be stated in terms of constituent structure at all. We
return to this matter in section 4.2.1.
Both the overt pronoun kare (‘he’) and the zero pronoun (‘little pro’) are regarded as
pronominal elements and subject to Principle B, as shown in (32):
(32)*Tarooi wa Hanako ni karei o/∅i sarakedasi-ta.
Taroo top Hanako dat he acc/pro reveal-past
*‘Tarooi revealed himi to Hanako.’
However, in the morphological causative construction, as shown in (33), kare and the zero
pronoun in the lower object position may be bound by the subject, but must be disjoint in
reference with the dative causee (Kitagawa 1986, Shibatani 1990).
(33) a. Tarooi wa Zirooj ni karei/*j o
bengo s-ase-ta.
Taroo top Ziroo dat he
acc defense do-caus-past
‘Tarooi made Zirooj defend himi/*j .’
b. Tarooi wa Zirooj ni ∅i/*j bengo s-ase-ta.

These facts have also been used as evidence to support the embedded analysis of the morphological causative.

This conclusion is questioned in some work such as Momoi (1985) and Iida (1992), but we will accept it
here.

12

Although kare exhibits various peculiarities that challenge its traditional classiﬁcation
as a simple pronominal,11 we will nonetheless assume here that it falls within the scope of
Principle B, and seek to explain this behavior, too, in terms of an argument-structure-based
theory of binding.
2.3.5

Quantiﬁer Scope

Finally, we consider a problem about quantiﬁer scope similar to that posed by the interaction
of adverbs and causatives. A quantiﬁed NP functioning as the lower object of a causative verb
form can take intermediate scope, i.e. can take scope over the verb stem, but be outscoped
by the causative operator, as illustrated in (34).
(34) Tanaka-sensei ga gakusei ni sansatu hon o
sirabe-sase-ta.
Prof. Tanaka nom student dat three book acc check-caus-past
‘Prof. Tanaka made the student check three books.’
Perhaps clearer examples of ambiguous scopal interpretation involving the quantiﬁer particle sika ‘except’ (recall Section 2.2.7) are discussed by Kitagawa (1986:138). Sentence (35a)
can mean either (i) only with respect to beer, I brought about a situation such that Taroo
drank it (not the whiskey, etc.) or (ii) I brought about a situation such that Taroo would
drink only beer (and no whiskey, etc.), and a similar ambiguity exists in the interpretation
of (35b).
(35) a. ano ban watasi wa Taroo ni biiru sika nom-ase-na-katta.
that night I
top Taroo dat beer except drink-caus-neg-past
‘That night, I made/let Taroo drink only beer.’ lit. ‘. . . not drink except beer.’
b. Rupan wa tesita ni hooseki sika nusum-ase-na-katta.
Lupin top follower dat jewelry except steal-caus-neg-past
‘Lupin made/let his followers steal only the jewelry.’
In light of these observations, it is essential that any lexical account of causatives make
clear how it can deal with such ambiguous scope assignments. Under the assumption that
the causative is a single lexical entity, the problem posed by such examples is basically the
problem of how to assign ‘word-internal’ scope to a quantiﬁed NP that appears external to
11

For example, kare does not serve as a bound variable: kare does not refer to the quantiﬁed subject NP
in (i) and (ii).
(i) ?*dono otokoi mo karei no tomodati o
hihan
si-ta.
which man also he gen friend

‘Every mani criticized hisi friend.’
(ii) *dono otokoi mo [Masaru ga karei o
hometa] koto ni odoroi-ta.
which man also Masaru nom he acc praised comp dat be.surprised-past
‘Every mani was surprised at the fact that Masaru praised himi .’
Furthermore, as Takubo (1990) observes, kare can only refer to a person whose identity has been established
in the speaker’s knowledge.

13

the lexical causative. The account must predict that a quantiﬁed argument of the causative
verb can be interpreted as having narrow scope with respect to the causative operator,
even though there is no syntactic constituent to serve as the basis of that particular scope
assignment.

Background and Basics of the Analysis
Essentials of HPSG

Our general proposal for a lexical treatment of -sase causatives is compatible with a variety
of lexicalist frameworks. The crucial ingredient we need is a theory of word formation that
allows constraints to apply to the argument structures of both the causative verb as a whole
and also the stem to which the causative suﬃx is added.12 The conception of argument
structure that we employ is based on essentially the same notion of subcat lists as that used
by Pollard and Sag (1987) and Gunji (1987). However, following recent work in HPSG,13
we distinguish argument structure (arg-st) from a word’s valence, which is speciﬁed in
terms of the features subject (subj), complements (comps), and specifier (spr).
Canonically, the values of a word’s valence features ‘add up’ (via list concatenation [or the
‘append’ relation]) to the verb’s arg-st value, as illustrated for the English words in (36).14

In this theory, it is the valence features (not arg-st) whose values are ‘cancelled oﬀ’ (in
a Categorial Grammar-like manner) as a head projects a phrase. A lexical head combines
with its complements and subject or speciﬁer (if any) according to the lexically inherited
speciﬁcation, as shown in (37).
12

The notion of argument structure draws from related work in many frameworks, for instance Kiparsky
(1987), Rappaport and Levin (1988), Bresnan and Zaenen (1990), Grimshaw (1990), Alsina (1993), and Butt
(1993). Our conception of argument structure is developed more fully in Manning and Sag (to appear). Let
us merely note that in this work argument structure has the following three properties: (1) it is a syntactic
construct that is crucially distinct from semantic structure (Manning 1994), but systematically related to
it (Davis 1996); (2) it is associated only with lexical signs, not phrases; and (3) it is the locus of binding
theory.

Here and throughout, we are ignoring the details of the feature geometry of HPSG signs, displaying only
those features that are of direct relevance. We return below to the issue of argument conservation, i.e. the
relation between the values of valence features and argument structure.

Unlike English, we assume for Japanese that subjects and complements can be cancelled in
any order and in any quantity, predicting clause-bounded scrambling.15
The arg-st list remains unaﬀected in the construction of syntactic phrases, except that,
in virtue of the various identities between arg-st members and members of valence lists,
the arg-st list’s members become fully speciﬁed as the valence list values are identiﬁed
with actual subjects, complements and speciﬁers. Once a complete phrase is constructed,
the lexical head’s arg-st list is a fully speciﬁed hierarchical argument structure. As we will
see below, it is the arg-st list that is the locus of binding theory.

3.2

Lexical organization and morphology

Basic lexical entries, which we may think of as morphological stems, give rise to further forms
through the application of morpholexical processes of various kinds. A number of techniques
have been developed for the description of complex morphological forms within lexicalist
frameworks, including the lexical rules approach sketched in Pollard and Sag (1987) and
Flickinger (1987), a type-based treatment of lexical rules developed by Copestake (1992),
and the ‘type-based’ approach to morphology developed by Riehemann (1993, 1995). Our
basic analysis of Japanese causatives is compatible with any of these approaches, but we will
here develop our account in terms of a theory of derivational types, which specify a declarative
relationship between a source stem and a result stem (which is morphologically ‘derived’
from it). Such an approach is closely related to what Copestake proposes (see also Meurers
(1995)). It has the advantages of allowing inheritance within the hierarchical lexicon of
HPSG to extend over both stem and word types and derivational types (as in Riehemann’s
15

Alternatively, following Kathol (1995), Japanese subjects and complements belong to a single ordering
domain, which sanctions essentially the same word order freedom in virtue of the paucity of Japanese linear
precedence constraints.

15

approach) while preserving the locality of information and lexical integrity of words within
the syntax that is well-captured within the lexical rules approach. The ﬁrst point means that
all of stem, word and derivational types are organized into a hierarchy of types, each of which
is associated with appropriate constraints. Extending the type hierarchy over derivational
types and their result types more easily allows the various patterns of causatives and their
linking patterns to be expressed. The second point implies that the formalism allows only a
constrained correspondence between two stems, and hence entails a certain notion of locality.
Only information speciﬁcally carried over from input to output by the rule is visible in
the context where the causative stem occurs, and the syntax has no other access to the
derivational history of a word.
That is, we assume that the basic lexical entry for the stem buy need stipulate only the
information shown in (38):




(38) buy: v-stem & strict-trans


content
buy-rel

where v(erb)-stem and strict-trans(itive) are distinct types associated with the constraints
illustrated in (39):
(39) a. strict-trans: arg-st
b. v-stem:

head

NP, NP
verb

Moreover, in the spirit of Wechsler (1995) and Davis (1996), we will assume that the
projection of semantic roles to syntactic argument structure is mediated by general principles
also formulated as constraints on lexical types. First, we assume, following Davis, that
buy-rel is a subtype of act(or)-und(ergoer)-rel. This leads to the attributes actor and
undergoer being appropriate for buy-rel, and this classiﬁcation, together with inheritance
of the constraints in (39), means that the stem buy inherits all the the information shown in
(40):


The classiﬁcation of buy-rel as a subtype of act-und-rel is also the key to explaining its
argument projection properties. Because of the general relation (a subsumption-preserving
homomorphism) that Davis establishes between stem types and types of semantic relation, it
follows that any stem like buy must obey the constraints established for superordinate stem
types.

16

To see this, let us examine the case of buy a bit more closely. Davis posits stem types
like those shown in (41).16

Because buy-rel is a subtype of act-und-rel , which in turn is a subtype of both actor-rel
and undergoer-rel, the strong correspondence between stem types and relation types requires
that the stem buy must also be a subtype of both stem types in (41). Thus the stem buy
must also inherit the constraints associated with those types. Unifying the constraints in
(41) with the information in (40), we derive the correct linking pattern for buy, as shown in
(42).

The canonical relation between arg-st and valence features is also determined by a
general type constraint, namely the constraint on the type stem.
(43) stem:






compression( 2 )

1 ⊕ 2

Here ‘⊕’ designates the operation of list concatenation (or append). For the moment, we may
assume that compression is just the identity function, and the constraints of this type just
cause the arg-st to be the list concatenation of the subj and comps lists (as illustrated
earlier). An independent constraint guarantees that a stem’s subj value is a singleton list.
Thus because strict-trans is a subtype of stem, buy must inherit the information in (43) as
well. Hence, in virtue of the system of lexical types and the associated type constraints, the
minimal lexical entry for the stem buy given in (38) above is suﬃcient to guarantee that buy
actually contains all the information in (44).
16

Davis’s work follows a tradition pioneered in particular by Gawron and Wechsler, incorporating certain
speciﬁc semantic analyses proposed by Pinker, and adapting ideas of Jackendoﬀ. For an overview of the
history of these ideas, see Davis (1996).

This result is obtained in a principled, deductive fashion from constraints of considerable
generality. In section 4, we will extend this treatment to include a lexical account of quantiﬁer
scoping as well.

3.3

Causative Stems

Causative stems bear a systematic phonological, syntactic and semantic relation to the verb
stems from which they are formed. The information that must be speciﬁed within any
analysis of Japanese causative stems is the following:
(45) a. -(s)ase is suﬃxed in the phonology,
b. the stem’s content is embedded as the effect argument of the derived form’s
content, which is a ternary cause-rel relation,
c. the derived form’s argument structure contains a causer subject and a causee complement (inter alia)
Our intention is to account for these properties in terms of a single derivational type,
caus(ative)-drv, the grammatical constraints particular to that type, and their interaction
with constraints on other related lexical types. We posit only the following constraints as
particular to the type caus-drv:17

First, let us consider the linking properties of causatives. The type caus-rel (like buy-rel )
is a subtype of act-und-rel. Hence (by the same reasoning outlined in the previous section)
17

The function Fsase (X) yields X+sase, if X is vowel-ﬁnal, and X+ase otherwise.

18

the relation/stem correspondence ensures that caus-stem is a subtype of both actor-stem and
undergoer-stem, which in turn entails that the ﬁrst arg-st member is linked to the causer
(actor) and the second arg-st member to the causee (undergoer), as shown in (47):

As for the rest of the causative stem’s arg-st, we will assume that this is a list consisting of
just the arg-st value of the non-causative stem, itself a list. The causative’s arg-st value
is thus a ‘nested’ list (a list that contains another list as a member), a fact that will play a
crucial role in our account of constraints on binding.
On our analysis, causatives acquire such nested argument lists in virtue of the fact that
caus-drv is a subtype of another type that we will call complex-pred(icate)-drv. A ﬁrst version
of the constraints on the type complex-pred-drv (in Japanese) are the following:18
(48) complex-pred-drv:

result



source

1, 2, 4

arg-st

PRO, . . .

4






‘PRO’ here designates a special type of element that is associated with the subject of the basic
stem. PRO is coindexed with some member of the (outer) arg-st list in accordance with
fundamentally semantic principles similar to those outlined for English control constructions
in Sag and Pollard (1991) (see Davis 1996). At least for Japanese causatives, though perhaps
not for all instances of the type comp-pred, it is the second arg-st member (the causee)
that is coindexed with PRO. Note that PRO is never an overt subject or complement.
Because of the list embedding in (48), we must modify our account of the linking relation
between arg-st and valence. This is where the function compression is needed. The idea
is still that the subj and comps lists add up to the argument structure, but we need to
remove the embedded lists and PRO elements from the argument structure. Informally,
what compression will do is ﬂatten out embedded lists in the arg-st list, promoting their
members to be on a par with the other list members and deleting embedded PROs in the
process (hence the name compression).19
18
19

We will later revise this to incorporate our account of lexicalized quantiﬁer scoping.
The function compression can be deﬁned as follows (‘←’ designates ‘only if’):

(i) compression(

)=

.

(ii) compression( P RO|Y ) = Z ← compression(Y ) = Z.
(iii) compression( X|Y ) = X|Z

← X is a synsem, compression(Y ) = Z.

(iv) compression( X|Y ) = Z ← X is a list , compression(X) = X , compression(Y ) = Y ,
append(X , Y ) = Z.

19

With this revision in place, we can now see how the constraints illustrated in this section
and the previous one interact to guarantee that the causative formed from the stem kaw‘buy’ has all the properties illustrated in (49):20

Stems like the one in (49) may be used as the basis for building the inﬂected words
that serve as syntactic heads. Inﬂection does not alter the valence, argument structure,
or semantic content in relevant ways, however. Thus, the information sketched in (49)
corresponds in all relevant respects to the information borne by a causative verb when it
functions as the lexical head of a syntactic phrase, combining with its complements according
to the same principles that govern the combination of noncausative heads. Let us now see
how this analysis can be applied ﬁrst to adjuncts and the alleged coordination facts, and
then to issues of binding and scope.

4.1

Analysis
Adjunct scope and “Coordination”

As we have seen, the verbal ending -te marks phrases that are better analyzed as adverbials,
not conjuncts. We provide a uniform treatment of scope that covers the interpretation of
adverbs, putative coordination, and a number of related issues. The analysis we will sketch,
if nothing more is said, entails that adverbs will be added to valence lists freely and hence,
given our assumptions about scrambling, freely ordered among other complements.
The essence of our proposal is a ‘zero derivation’ type that adds an adjunct onto a verb
stem’s arg-st list (and hence onto its comps list). We couch this proposal in terms of
20

We leave a number of matters unresolved here. For case assignment, we assume general case assigning
rules for Japanese (which may make reference to structural, lexical, or semantic features), but do not attempt
to develop them here.

Stems resulting from this type have a semantic content that is based on the adverb complement it will combine with, at the same time making the content of the source value (the
stem from which the atr-stem is ‘derived’) the argument of that adverbial. Since atr-stem
is a subtype of canon-stem (see above), it also follows that the adverb is the last element of
the atr-stem’s comps list.
Note that the deﬁnition of compression given in fn. 19 interacts with the constraints in
(50) to ensure that the subj and comps lists of a causative stem are correctly treated.
For instance (51) shows the type that results when the basic verb stem kaw- ‘buy’ is ﬁrst
causativized and then undergoes adverb type raising (hence giving the selected adverb wide
scope):

Our analysis diﬀers from categorial analyses in that it employs a highly restricted, lexically-governed
version of type raising. Its work is done before other arguments are combined with the raised functor.
Nonetheless, all uses of our rule correspond to theorems of the Lambek calculus. Similar proposals for
adverbial type raising in HPSG are made for French by Abeill´ and Godard (1994), for Dutch by van Noord
e
and Bouma (1994), and for English by Kim and Sag (1995).

21

But of course it is the possibility of the the adverb modifying within the scope of cause-rel
that is more challenging for a lexicalist theory. So consider again the conjunctive adverbial
in (52).

The canonical stem kaw1 discussed in the previous section gives rise through atr-drv to a
phonologically indistinguishable counterpart kaw2 of type atr-stem that must combine with
an adverbial complement, as sketched in (53).

Note that the adverbial phrase in this example appears higher in the tree than the
causative verb, but nonetheless modiﬁes only the verbal stem kaw . Given that the modiﬁcation relations are ﬁxed by the lexical entries and the phrases they project, the same
interpretation results from a scrambled example such as (57):
(57) Ken wa Naomi ni atarasii kutu o
[hurui kutu o
sute-te]
kaw-ase-ta.
Ken top Naomi dat new
shoes acc old
shoes acc throw-ger buy-caus-past
‘Ken made Naomi throw away old shoes and buy new shoes.’
Allowing type-raising predicates to place adverbs on their arg-st list in this way thus
provides a straightforward account of both adverbial scope possibilities, and of the ability of
-te phrases to scramble.

Binding Theory
Reﬂexives

The HPSG binding theory is based on hierarchical argument structure rather than constituent structure. As Pollard and Sag (1992, 1994) demonstrate, this approach to binding
provides an immediate solution to a variety of problems facing accounts of English binding
stated purely in terms of constituency-based notions such as c-command. Our account of
23

binding in Japanese is based on principles identical to those posited for English by Pollard
and Sag, augmented by a new principle for long distance anaphors, such as Japanese zibun,
identical to that proposed for Mandarin by Xue, Pollard and Sag (1994). These principles
are stated informally in (58).
(58) HPSG Binding Theory:
Principle
Principle
Principle
Principle

A. A locally o-commanded anaphor must be locally o-bound.
B. A personal pronoun must be locally o-free.
C. A non-pronoun must be o-free.
Z. A long distance anaphor must be o-bound.

The eﬀect of these principles is to require an anaphor to be coindexed with a less oblique
arg-st member, if there is such a less oblique coargument. Otherwise, anaphors are free
(subject to various discourse and processing considerations) to refer to appropriate elements
in the discourse context.
The Japanese reﬂexive zibun is clearly long distance, and hence properly governed by
Principle Z. However, as we saw earlier, its antecedence is usually restricted to subjects.
Manning (1994, 1996) argues that the correct constraint in these cases is the principle in
(59):
(59) A-subject principle: Some anaphors must be bound by an entity that is ﬁrst on some
arg-st list.
Kitagawa (1986), citing unpublished work by K. Kurata, has argued that the expressions
mizukara ‘self’ and zibun-zisin ‘self’ are true anaphors that obey Principle A. However,
there are reasons to be skeptical of this claim. There are numerous counterexamples to the
putative generalization that mizukara ‘self’ and zibun-zisin ‘self’ must have a local binder,
as illustrated by the following examples:
(60) a. Zibun-zisini ga hihan
s-are-ta
koto ga Tarooi o
nayamase-te iru.
self
nom criticism do-pass-past comp nom Taroo acc bother-prog-pres
(lit.) ‘The fact that self was criticized bothers Taroo.’
b. kono hoosiki no moto-de wa, wakai toki-ni zibun-zisini ga
this system gen under top young when self
nom
siharat-ta kingaku ga yokinsyai no nenkin ni tuika deki-ru.
pay-past amount nom depositer gen pension to add can-pres
‘Under this system, the amount that a depositer paid at his younger age can be
added to his pension plans.’
These might be explained away as ‘exempt’ anaphors, that is as anaphors that, because they
lack a local o-commanding element (nothing outranks a subject in an arg-st list), are not
constrained to be locally o-bound. This approach is possible in the HPSG binding theory
(see the formulation of Principle A given above), but not in other binding theories we are
familiar with. However we doubt that this kind of analysis is suﬃcient to explain examples
like the following, where zibun-zishin is locally o-commanded, but not locally o-bound.
24

‘Prof. Tanakai got shocked at the fact that the students didn’t rely on not only the
school authorities but also himi .
Moreover, as suggested to us by Takao Gunji (personal communication, July 1993) it may
simply be the emphatic nature of these expressions that makes them tend to prefer a local
antecedent (at least in simple examples) without their actually being subject to Principle A.
This line of reasoning, quite like that followed by Iida (1992) in her account of zibun-binding,
seems more likely to provide a systematic account of the entire range of observations about
zibun-zishin-binding.
Thus we will tentatively regard both zibun and zibun-zisin as subject to Principle Z and
the A-subject Principle. We may now examine the predictions made by our lexical analysis
of causatives. Recall that in this analysis, the arg-st list of the lower verb is embedded in
the causative verb’s arg-st list, as illustrated in (62).

In (62), the lower object 3 appears on the embedded arg-st list of the verb. Thus according
to the binding theory in (58), if the lower object is a true anaphor, then it is locally ocommanded and can be locally o-bound by only one element – PRO (coindexed with the
causee). This prediction contradicts the claims made by Kitagawa (1986) and Yatabe (1993)
about the ambiguity of examples like (63).
(63) Tarooi ga Zirooj ni aete
zibun-zisini/j o
hihan
s-ase-ta.
Taroo nom Ziroo dat purposefully self
acc criticism do-caus-past
‘Tarooi purposefully made Zirooj criticize himselfi/j .’ (Kitagawa 1986:(92))
25

Both of these researchers assume that the grammar of causatives must be reconciled with
this ambiguity by somehow providing two domains in which the anaphor can be bound.
However, on the assumption that zibun-zisin is not a true anaphor, but a long distance
anaphor subject to Principle Z and the A-subject constraint (requiring that the binder of
zibun-zisin be the ﬁrst element of some argument structure list), the ambiguity of (63) is
unproblematic. On this theory zibun-zisin is free to be bound by any o-commanding asubject, and so we predict that it can be bound by either of the higher a-subjects, Taroo or
Ziroo.
4.2.2

Pronouns

Now let us consider again the pronominal coreference facts shown in (64).
(64) Tarooi wa Zirooj ni kare o /∅i/*j bengo s-ase-ta.
Taroo top Ziroo dat him acc/pro defense do-caus-past
‘Tarooi made Zirooj defend himi/*j .’
The zero pronoun, or kare, in the lower object position allows the surface subject, but not
the lower subject (the causee), as it antecedent.
Here, again, we ﬁnd conﬁrmation of our nested argument structure analysis. The observed
facts follow immediately from the nested arg-st analysis and the assumption that missing
arguments and kare are both pronominals. Considering again (62), we see that coindexation
of the subject and the lower object is possible, because there is no arg-st list where both
elements occur. However, the lower object cannot be coindexed with the causee, because the
causee shares an index with the lower subject, hence indexing the lower object in this way
would make the lower object locally o-bound, in violation of Principle B.
Hence, by assuming simply that Japanese has pronominal arguments, we can use the very
same binding principles that have been applied to English and other languages. Principle B
rules out coreference between the lower object and the causee, but nothing blocks coreference
between the lower object and the subject because the surface subject isn’t on the embedded
arg-st list.
4.2.3

Adverbial -nagara clauses

This understanding of a-subjects, together with the preceding account of adjuncts is also
the basis of the treatment we would give of adverbial -nagara clauses, which can be placed
freely in a sentence like other adverbials, and which can be controlled by any a-subject, but
not other noun phrases, as is shown for causatives in (65):
(65) Taroo wa kodomotati ni utai-nagara tegami o
kak-ase-ta.
Taroo top children
dat sing-while letter acc write-caus-past
‘Tarooi made the childrenj write a letter while hei /theyj sang.’

4.3

Quantiﬁer Scope

As noted in section 2.3.5, quantiﬁed NPs pose a problem similar to that of adverbs: A
quantiﬁed NP functioning as the lower object of a causative verb form can take intermediate
26

scope, i.e. although external to the lexical causative, it can scope over the verb stem, but
within the scope of the causative operator, as illustrated in (66).
(66) Tanaka-sensei ga gakusei ni sansatu hon o
sirabe-sase-ta.
Prof. Tanaka nom student dat three book acc check-caus-past
‘Prof. Tanaka made [the student check three books].’
In order to deal with this matter, we must ﬁrst enter into a slight digression about the
treatment of quantiﬁer scope in HPSG.
4.3.1

Quantiﬁer scope in HPSG

The theory of quantiﬁer scope presented in chapter 8 of Pollard and Sag 1994 (P&S) is
based on the technique of quantiﬁer storage pioneered in Cooper (1983). ‘Cooper storage’
is a method allowing a variable to go proxy for a quantiﬁer’s contribution to the content
of a sentence, while the quantiﬁer which binds that variable is placed in a ‘store’. Stored
quantiﬁers are gathered up from the daughters of a phrase and passed up to successively
higher levels of structure until an appropriate scope assignment locus is reached. There
quantiﬁer(s) may be retrieved from storage and integrated into the meaning, receiving a
wide scope interpretation, as illustrated in (67) in terms of the HPSG features qs(tore)
and cont(ent):

On P&S’s version of Cooper’s theory, content is speciﬁed for two attributes: quants
(quantifiers) and nuc(leus), the former taking a list of generalized quantiﬁers as its
value, the latter taking what we have here treated as relations. On their theory, all quantiﬁers
‘start out’ in storage, and retrieval (removal of some set of quantiﬁers from the qstore set
and appending of some ordering of the removed set to the head’s quants list) is allowed
at higher levels of structure, subject to various constraints. This means that the scope
assigned to a quantiﬁer can in principle be any higher semantic domain, i.e. any semantic
domain containing the semantics of the minimal clause containing the quantiﬁed NP. P&S’s
version also diﬀers from Cooper’s in eliminating the non-branching structure (the ‘S-over-S’
structure in (67)) associated with retrieval.
However, the theory presented by P&S has at least one serious defect22 – its failure to
provide for the possibility that in raising or extraction constructions, a quantiﬁer may have
scope corresponding to a lower syntactic position. As is well known, a sentence like (68),
for example, allows a ‘de dicto’ reading where the matrix subject takes narrow scope with
respect to seems:
(68) A unicorn seems to be approaching.
‘It seems that there is a unicorn approaching.’
In recent work, Pollard and Yoo (forthcoming) suggest the beginnings of a solution to this
problem. First, they propose to make qstore a feature of local objects, rather than a feature
of the highest level of grammatical structure (the sign), as P&S proposed. This revision has
the consequence that within raising and extraction constructions, the stored quantiﬁers are
identiﬁed. That is, the qstore value of the subject of seems in a cascaded raising structure
like (68) is also the qstore value of the (unexpressed) subject of to, the qstore value of
the subject of be, and the qstore value of the subject of the verb approaching. Thus if the
NP a unicorn in (68) has an existential quantiﬁer in its qstore, so does the subj value of
the lowest verb in (68) – the verb that assigns a semantic role to the index bound by that
quantiﬁer.
Pollard and Yoo propose to change the way storage works, so that unscoped quantiﬁers
are passed up to the mother in a headed structure not from all the daughters (as in Cooper’s
account or that of P&S), but only from the semantic head daughter. To achieve this, they let
the qstore value of a verb V be the set union of the qstore values of V’s arg-st members
(at least those arg-st members that are assigned a role in the content value of V). We
illustrate the eﬀect of their proposal in terms of the Quantiﬁer Amalgamation Constraint
(69a), which is formulated in terms of the merge-quants relation deﬁned in (69b).23

Let us ignore adjuncts for present purposes, considering only the case where the syntactic
head and semantic head are the same, as in a structure like (70). S-level retrieval of stored
quantiﬁers is done in accordance with the constraint sketched in (71):24

We use
to designate a relation of contained set diﬀerence: if Σ2 is a subset of Σ1 , then Σ1 Σ2 is
the standard set diﬀerence of Σ1 with respect to Σ2 ; otherwise, the contained set diﬀerence is not deﬁned.
Note also that up until now we have been showing the value of cont(ent) as simply the nucl(eus) value
which excludes the eﬀect of quantiﬁcation, but in the semantic theory of HPSG, a clausal cont has both a
nucleus (nucl) and a list of the quantiﬁers scoped at that node (quants), as in the signs in this section.

29

And if we now reconsider the tree in (70) in light of the retrieval scheme sketched in (71),
we can see the possibility of S-level quantiﬁer retrieval of the sort sketched in (72):

This correctly allows for both possible scopings for (72). It also assigns to (68) a reading
where the subject has narrow scope with respect to seems, because qstore is now part of
local and hence the subj value of seems is the subj value of to and be and hence is the
subj value (and ﬁrst arg-st member) of approaching, which collects its own qstore value
from the qstore values of its arguments. Thus the qstore of approaching in (68) contains
a-unicorn and that quantiﬁer can be retrieved from storage anywhere in the tree higher
than approaching. Retrieval at the VP node dominating just approaching will produce the
scoping of a-unicorn inside the scope of seems.
A potential problem with this approach, however, is that it lets retrieval happen in too
many places. Unless one stipulates further constraints, this system (like the one in P&S)
30

produces spurious analyses of every available reading. For example, allowing both S and VP
retrieval in structures like (72) produces each possible scoping in three diﬀerent ways (each
retrieval order at one node, or one quantiﬁer retrieved at each node).
4.3.2

Lexicalizing quantiﬁer scoping

The adaptation of the Pollard and Yoo analysis that we propose to solve the scope problems
discussed in section 2.3.5 will at the same time eliminate this redundancy in the Pollard/Yoo
system. We propose to let retrieval and scope assignment be entirely lexical in nature. By
stating lexical constraints to the eﬀect that a word’s quants value is an ordering of some
set subtracted from the union of the qstore values of the verb’s arguments, it is possible in
fact to eliminate phrasal retrieval and the feature retrieved entirely. A lexical head passes
up in its qstore value the quantiﬁers from its arguments which are not already scoped in
its quants value, or earlier retrieved in its qretr value. These unscoped quantiﬁers are
thus passed up into the qstore value of the phrase projected by the lexical head. At this
point, they are seen, and possibly retrieved by the head of the next higher syntactic domain.
This proposal, similar in certain ways to lexical type raising, involves modifying the
Quantiﬁer Amalgamation Constraint as follows:25

The importance of the shift from word to stem, and the need to introduce a new-qs(tore)
attribute will be discussed in a moment. For the moment, one can assume that the value of
new-qs is always the empty set. Now, ﬁrst, note that in consequence of (73) the word reads
(formed without relevant changes from the stem read) must be constrained along the lines
sketched in (74).
25

The function toplevel returns just the unembedded members of an arg-st list. In other words, except
for cases of nested arg-st lists formed by complex predicates, it will also act as an identity function. It can
be deﬁned as follows:
(i) toplevel(

)=

.

(ii) toplevel( X|Y ) = X|Z

← X is a synsem, toplevel(Y ) = Z.

(iii) toplevel( X|Y ) = Z ← X is a list , toplevel(Y ) = Z

Other aspects of the Pollard/Yoo theory remain unchanged. Thus, each lexical head gets
a chance to scope the quantiﬁers of its role-assigned arguments, and those quantiﬁers from
arguments that are not scoped remain in the verb’s qstore to be passed up to higher levels
of structure. There are exactly as many scope assignment points in a sentence as there are
lexical heads. And since there is no structure-based retrieval, a sentence like (68) has no
spurious semantic derivations. The constraints that are part of the lexical entry of the word
reads simply allow two readings (corresponding to the two distinct orderings of the quantiﬁers
on the verb’s quants list). Note ﬁnally that this modiﬁcation of the Pollard/Yoo theory
still produces the correct two readings for A unicorn seems to be approaching, allowing seems
or approaching to assign scope to a-unicorn.26
4.3.3

Quantiﬁer scope with morphological causatives

Let us now return to our analysis of causatives. We have already modiﬁed the Quantiﬁer
Amalgamation Constraint as in (73). In consequence of this modiﬁcation, the verb stem
sirabe ‘check’ must inherit all the constraints shown in (75):

The constraints speciﬁed in (75) say simply (i) that the quants value of the stem’s content
is an ordering of some subset of the argument’s qstore values and (ii) that those quantiﬁers
26

In order to eliminate all spurious ambiguity in inﬁnitival structures, we must state some further constraint
ensuring that semantically vacuous raising verbs like to and be do not assign scope lexically. This is easily
formulated as a lexical constraint requiring that elements like to and be identify their content value with
that of their complement (lexicalizing one part of a constraint proposed by Pollard and Yoo).

not in quants are in the stem’s qstore value.
The lexical retrieval for a complex predicate is similar, but it must take into account the
possibility that the stem from which it is formed may have already assigned scope to some
but not necessarily all of the quantiﬁers from the embedded argument structure. This is
where the attribute new-qs comes in. We will say that for most basic stem types, including
verb stems, the value of new-qs is the empty set. But for certain derived stem types such
as those licensed by complex-pred-drv, the value of new-qs will be the set of quantiﬁers that
were not yet scoped in the source stem from which they were built. This will be achieved
by the following revision to the constraints on the type complex-pred-drv:27

As a result, a causative stem, of type caus-stem, will obey the licensing constraints of complexpred-drv above, and the further licensing constraints of caus-drv, and in addition the causstem will be subject to the revised version of the Quantiﬁer Amalgamation Constraint.
Application of the Quantiﬁer Amalgamation Constraint to the caus-stem will allow there to
be complements of the basic stem whose quantiﬁers scope over caus-rel, because the causstem inherits into its qstore any elements in the qstore of the stem (that is elements that
were not scoped at the level of the stem), via the attribute new-qs. On the other hand, the
input stem to complex-pred-drv may have ‘already scoped’ some of its quantiﬁers. That is,
some quantiﬁers may appear in the source stem’s quants value. Such elements will not
appear in the qstore of the source stem (through the regular workings of the Quantiﬁer
Amalgamation Constraint), and so will not appear in the new-qs of the derived causative
stem. At the level of the causative stem, the Quantiﬁer Amalgamation Constraint collects
only quantiﬁers in unembedded elements of the arg-st – this is where the function toplevel
comes in – and adds to those quantiﬁers any as yet unscoped quantiﬁers in the new-qs
set. As a result, each element of the arg-st will end up being retrieved precisely once.
The subject of the embedded stem (the PRO coindexed with the causee) of course cannot
contribute to the embedded stem’s quants value, a fact that is simply accommodated if
PRO’s qstore is assumed to be empty. By this mechanism, complements of the entire
causative verb can be assigned scope within the effect argument of cause-rel, but any
elements that are not assigned assigned narrow scope in this manner will be inherited by the
causative stem and must be assigned wider scope somewhere within the sentence.
We illustrate in (78) one possible way of instantiating the constraints we have outlined
for a causative stem, namely the one corresponding to the problematic reading of (77) –
where cause-rel outscopes 3-books which in turn outscopes check-rel:
27

The attribute new-qs is taken from Przepi´rkowski (1997), where it is used in the lexical entry of quano
tiﬁer words to introduce new quantiﬁers. His paper also presents a development and further formalization
of the approach to lexicalizing quantiﬁer scoping introduced here.

Thus these lexical types allow exactly the desired result – the direct object of the lower verb
may contribute a quantiﬁer that scopes wide or narrow with respect to caus-rel. In the case
of (77), the qstore of the NP sansatu-no hon-o is the singleton set {3-books}, and this will
serve to instantiate the tag 6 in (78), thus producing the desired narrow scope assignment.
In sum, the lexically based revision of the Pollard/Yoo theory of quantiﬁer storage and
quantiﬁer scoping that we have sketched seems to ﬁt well with our theory of Japanese
causatives. Although complex words of Japanese preserve their lexical integrity (Bresnan
and Mchombo 1995), NPs external to those words may still be assigned scope intermediate
to the semantic elements of a lexicalized complex predicate like a causative. This result
follows once verbal stems, rather than syntactic phrases or words, are taken as the locus for
quantiﬁer scope assignment.

4.4

Passives

A ﬁnal point to be addressed is the interaction of causativization with passivization. It is
well-known (e.g. Kuno 1973) that causatives of transitive verbs allow passivization of the -ni
marked phrase, but not of the -o marked (lower) object, as in (79).28
28

Ishikawa (1985) questions this generalization suggesting that passivization is possible in examples such
as Hukei o yorokob-aseru tame, toku-ni muzukasii zi ga kodomotati ni kak-ase-rare-ta ‘In order to impress
the parents, particularly diﬃcult characters were caused (by the teachers) to be written by the children.’

34

(79) a. Mitiko ga Taroo ni Ziroo o
yob-ase-ta.
Mitiko nom Taroo dat Ziroo acc call-caus-past
‘Mitiko made Taroo call Ziroo.’
b. Taroo ga Mitiko ni Ziroo o

Taroo nom Mitiko by Ziroo acc call-caus-pass-past
‘Taroo was made by Mitiko to call Ziroo.’
c.*Ziroo ga Mitiko ni(-yotte) Taroo ni yob-ase-rare-ta.
Ziroo nom Mitiko by
Taroo dat call-caus-pass-past
‘(lit.) Ziroo was made called by Taroo by Mitiko.’
In contrast, monomorphemic ditransitive verbs allow passivization of either object.
Here we adopt Hasegawa’s (1981) suggestion that passivization of the lower object is
impossible because it doesn’t have a thematic role (i.e. it is not the value of a role attribute)
in the top-level content of the clause. This suggestion receives independent support from
the fact that this constraint appears to hold generally in Japanese.
First, (80) shows that idioms (whose argument we assume not to be assigned a thematic
role), cannot passivize (Yatabe 1990):
(80) a. Kenitiroo ga saba
o
yon-da
Kenitiroo nom mackerel acc read-past
‘Kenichiroo gave a false count.’
b.*saba
ga Kenitiroo ni yom-are-ta
mackerel nom Kenitiroo dat read-pass-past
Further, Kuno (1976) argues that (81a) is an example of raising-to-object in Japanese and
he notes that the raised object fails to passivize as can be seen in (81b).
(81) a. Noriko ga Masaru o
hannin da to
omot-ta.
Noriko nom Masaru acc culprit is comp think-past
‘Noriko thinks Masaru to be the culprit.’
b.*Masaru ga Noriko ni hannin da to
omow-are-ta.
Masaru nom Noriko dat culprit is comp think-pass-past
‘Masaru was thought to be the culprit by Noriko.’
Thus the failure of passivization is expected on independent grounds, and provides no evidence against the merged argument structures embodied in our analysis.
But our surveys suggest that such examples are judged unacceptable by the vast majority of Japanese native
speakers.

Conclusion

This paper began by mentioning the many phenomena that motivate a lexical analysis of
Japanese causatives. Such phenomena support the Lexical Integrity Principle of Bresnan
and Mchombo (1995), and argue that Japanese causatives behave as a single clause with
respect to case, word order, and similar properties. In addition, we have examined the
diverse phenomena that have been assumed to motivate the multiclausal analysis of Japanese
causatives, reaching the conclusion that all such data are handled at least as well or better
within our single-clause, embedded argument structure approach.
The solutions we have been led to bear on larger issues than the particulars of Japanese
grammar discussed here. For example, our proposed solution to the problems posed by
the interaction of adverb scope and causatives builds crucially on an analysis where heads
select for their modiﬁers, rather than the familiar treatment where adjuncts select for the
phrases that they combine with syntactically. The theory we have sketched here, unlike the
more familiar alternative, provides a uniform account of both sublexical and supralexical
scoping, and hence may deserve consideration as the basis for the treatment of adverbs more
generally. Similarly, our lexicalized account of quantiﬁer scoping, which eliminates syntactic
retrieval entirely from the theory of Cooper storage, allows sublexical scoping of a sort that
is inconsistent with other approaches, including that of Pollard and Yoo (forthcoming).
We started out with Kiparsky’s observation on the non-arbitrariness of the diverse properties that causative constructions exhibit. The account we have developed provides the
beginnings of an explanation for the duality of causatives. Since case marking, agreement
and word order are all determined by the interaction of principles constraining the way lexical
items can appear in constituent structures, it follows that, with respect to these properties,
morphological causatives behave just like other words of similar valence, exhibiting essentially
all the properties of single lexical items. But construal processes such as honoriﬁcation, binding and quantiﬁer ﬂoating are in general sensitive to argument structure, as Yatabe (1993)
and Manning (1994) have observed. Thus our analysis of causative constructions in terms
of complex argument structures leads us to predict evidence of embedding with all and only
phenomena of this type. We ﬁnd these results highly suggestive, not just for the treatment
of causatives, but for the design of grammar in the broadest sense.
