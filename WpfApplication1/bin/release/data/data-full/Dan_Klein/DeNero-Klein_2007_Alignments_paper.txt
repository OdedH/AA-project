Abstract
Extracting tree transducer rules for syntactic MT systems can be hindered by word
alignment errors that violate syntactic correspondences. We propose a novel model for
unsupervised word alignment which explicitly takes into account target language constituent structure, while retaining the robustness and efﬁciency of the HMM alignment
model. Our model’s predictions improve the
yield of a tree transducer extraction system,
without sacriﬁcing alignment quality. We
also discuss the impact of various posteriorbased methods of reconciling bidirectional
alignments.

Introduction

Syntactic methods are an increasingly promising approach to statistical machine translation, being both
algorithmically appealing (Melamed, 2004; Wu,
1997) and empirically successful (Chiang, 2005;
Galley et al., 2006). However, despite recent
progress, almost all syntactic MT systems, indeed
statistical MT systems in general, build upon crude
legacy models of word alignment. This dependence
runs deep; for example, Galley et al. (2006) requires
word alignments to project trees from the target language to the source, while Chiang (2005) requires
alignments to induce grammar rules.
Word alignment models have not stood still in recent years. Unsupervised methods have seen substantial reductions in alignment error (Liang et al.,
2006) as measured by the now much-maligned AER
metric. A host of discriminative methods have been
introduced (Taskar et al., 2005; Moore, 2005; Ayan

Dan Klein

and Dorr, 2006). However, few of these methods
have explicitly addressed the tension between word
alignments and the syntactic processes that employ
them (Cherry and Lin, 2006; Daum´ III and Marcu,
e
2005; Lopez and Resnik, 2005).
We are particularly motivated by systems like the
one described in Galley et al. (2006), which constructs translations using tree-to-string transducer
rules. These rules are extracted from a bitext annotated with both English (target side) parses and word
alignments. Rules are extracted from target side
constituents that can be projected onto contiguous
spans of the source sentence via the word alignment.
Constituents that project onto non-contiguous spans
of the source sentence do not yield transducer rules
themselves, and can only be incorporated into larger
transducer rules. Thus, if the word alignment of a
sentence pair does not respect the constituent structure of the target sentence, then the minimal translation units must span large tree fragments, which do
not generalize well.
We present and evaluate an unsupervised word
alignment model similar in character and computation to the HMM model (Ney and Vogel, 1996),
but which incorporates a novel, syntax-aware distortion component which conditions on target language
parse trees. These trees, while automatically generated and therefore imperfect, are nonetheless (1) a
useful source of structural bias and (2) the same trees
which constrain future stages of processing anyway.
In our model, the trees do not rule out any alignments, but rather softly inﬂuence the probability of
transitioning between alignment positions. In particular, transition probabilities condition upon paths
through the target parse tree, allowing the model to
prefer distortions which respect the tree structure.

Our model generates word alignments that better
respect the parse trees upon which they are conditioned, without sacriﬁcing alignment quality. Using
the joint training technique of Liang et al. (2006)
to initialize the model parameters, we achieve an
AER superior to the GIZA++ implementation of
IBM model 4 (Och and Ney, 2003) and a reduction of 56.3% in aligned interior nodes, a measure
of agreement between alignments and parses. As a
result, our alignments yield more rules, which better
match those we would extract had we used manual
alignments.

Two transducer rules, t1 → s1 and t2 → s2 ,
can be combined to form larger translation units
by composing t1 and t2 at a shared frontier node
and appropriately concatenating s1 and s2 . However, no technique has yet been shown to robustly
extract smaller component rules from a large transducer rule. Thus, for the purpose of maximizing the
coverage of the extracted translation model, we prefer to extract many small, minimal rules and generate larger rules via composition. Maximizing the
number of frontier nodes supports this goal, while
inducing many aligned interior nodes hinders it.

2.2

Translation with Tree Transducers

In a tree transducer system, as in phrase-based systems, the coverage and generality of the transducer
inventory is strongly related to the effectiveness of
the translation model (Galley et al., 2006). We will
demonstrate that this coverage, in turn, is related to
the degree to which initial word alignments respect
syntactic correspondences.
2.1

Rule Extraction

Galley et al. (2004) proposes a method for extracting
tree transducer rules from a parallel corpus. Given a
source language sentence s, a target language parse
tree t of its translation, and a word-level alignment,
their algorithm identiﬁes the constituents in t which
map onto contiguous substrings of s via the alignment. The root nodes of such constituents – denoted
frontier nodes – serve as the roots and leaves of tree
fragments that form minimal transducer rules.
Frontier nodes are distinguished by their compatibility with the word alignment. For a constituent c
of t, we consider the set of source words sc that are
aligned to c. If none of the source words in the linear closure s∗ (the words between the leftmost and
c
rightmost members of sc ) aligns to a target word outside of c, then the root of c is a frontier node. The
remaining interior nodes do not generate rules, but
can play a secondary role in a translation system.1
The roots of null-aligned constituents are not frontier nodes, but can attach productively to multiple
minimal rules.
1

Interior nodes can be used, for instance, in evaluating
syntax-based language models. They also serve to differentiate
transducer rules that have the same frontier nodes but different
internal structure.

Word Alignment Interactions

We now turn to the interaction between word alignments and the transducer extraction algorithm. Consider the example sentence in ﬁgure 1A, which
demonstrates how a particular type of alignment error prevents the extraction of many useful transducer
rules. The mistaken link [la ⇒ the] intervenes between ax´ s and carri` r, which both align within an
e
e
English adjective phrase, while la aligns to a distant
subspan of the English parse tree. In this way, the
alignment violates the constituent structure of the
English parse.
While alignment errors are undesirable in general, this error is particularly problematic for a
syntax-based translation system. In a phrase-based
system, this link would block extraction of the
phrases [ax´ s sur la carri` r ⇒ career oriented] and
e
e
[les emplois ⇒ the jobs] because the error overlaps
with both. However, the intervening phrase [emplois sont ⇒ jobs are] would still be extracted, at
least capturing the transfer of subject-verb agreement. By contrast, the tree transducer extraction
method fails to extract any of these fragments: the
alignment error causes all non-terminal nodes in
the parse tree to be interior nodes, excluding preterminals and the root. Figure 1B exposes the consequences: a wide array of desired rules are lost during
extraction.
The degree to which a word alignment respects
the constituent structure of a parse tree can be quantiﬁed by the frequency of interior nodes, which indicate alignment patterns that cross constituent boundaries. To achieve maximum coverage of the translation model, we hope to infer tree-violating alignments only when syntactic structures truly diverge.

an alignment error that violates the constituent structure of the English sentence. The resulting frontier
nodes are printed in bold; all nodes would be frontier nodes under a correct alignment. (B) shows a small

single alignment error prevents the extraction of all rules in (i) and many more. This alignment pattern was
observed in our test set and corrected by our model.

Unsupervised Word Alignment

To allow for this preference, we present a novel conditional alignment model of a foreign (source) sentence f = {f1 , ..., fJ } given an English (target) sentence e = {e1 , ..., eI } and a target tree structure t.
Like the classic IBM models (Brown et al., 1994),
our model will introduce a latent alignment vector
a = {a1 , ..., aJ } that speciﬁes the position of an
aligned target word for each source word. Formally,
our model describes p(a, f|e, t), but otherwise borrows heavily from the HMM alignment model of
Ney and Vogel (1996).
The HMM model captures the intuition that the

alignment vector a will in general progress across
the sentence e in a pattern which is mostly local, perhaps with a few large jumps. That is, alignments are
locally monotonic more often than not.
Formally, the HMM model factors as:
J

pd (aj |aj− , j)p (fj |eaj )

p(a, f|e) =
j=1

where j− is the position of the last non-null-aligned
source word before position j, p is a lexical transfer
model, and pd is a local distortion model. As in all
such models, the lexical component p is a collection of unsmoothed multinomial distributions over

foreign words.
The distortion model pd (aj |aj− , j) is a distribution over the signed distance aj − aj− , typically
parameterized as a multinomial, Gaussian or exponential distribution. The implementation that serves
as our baseline uses a multinomial distribution with
separate parameters for j = 1, j = J and shared
parameters for all 1 < j < J. Null alignments have
ﬁxed probability at any position. Inference over a
requires only the standard forward-backward algorithm.
3.1

Syntax-Sensitive Distortion

The broad and robust success of the HMM alignment model underscores the utility of its assumptions: that word-level translations can be usefully
modeled via ﬁrst-degree Markov transitions and independent lexical productions. However, its distortion model considers only string distance, disregarding the constituent structure of the English sentence.
To allow syntax-sensitive distortion, we consider
a new distortion model of the form pd (aj |aj− , j, t).
We condition on t via a generative process that transitions between two English positions by traversing
the unique shortest path ρ(aj− ,aj ,t) through t from
aj− to aj . We constrain ourselves to this shortest
path using a staged generative process.
Stage 1 (P OP(ˆ ), S TOP(ˆ )): Starting in the leaf
n
n
node at aj− , we choose whether to S TOP or
P OP from child to parent, conditioning on the
type of the parent node n. Upon choosing
ˆ
S TOP, we transition to stage 2.
Stage 2 (M OVE(ˆ , d)): Again, conditioning on the
n
type of the parent n of the current node n, we
ˆ
choose a sibling n based on the signed distance
¯
d = φn (n) − φn (¯ ), where φn (n) is the index
ˆ
ˆ n
ˆ
of n in the child list of n. Zero distance moves
ˆ
are disallowed. After exactly one M OVE, we
transition to stage 3.
Stage 3 (P USH(n, φn (˘ ))): Given the current node
n
n, we select one of its children n, conditioning
˘
on the type of n and the position of the child
φn (˘ ). We continue to P USH until reaching a
n
leaf.
This process is a ﬁrst-degree Markov walk
through the tree, conditioning on the current node

and its immediate surroundings at each step. We enforce the property that ρ(aj− ,aj ,t) be unique by staging the process and disallowing zero distance moves
in stage 2. Figure 2 gives an example sequence of
tree transitions for a small parse tree.
The parameterization of this distortion model follows directly from its generative process. Given a
path ρ(aj− ,aj ,t) with r = k + m + 3 nodes including
the two leaves, the nearest common ancestor, k intervening nodes on the ascent and m on the descent,
we express it as a triple of staged tree transitions that
include k P OPs, a S TOP, a M OVE, and m P USHes:

{P OP(n2 ), ..., P OP(nk+1 ), S TOP(nk+2 )}


{M OVE (nk+2 , φ(nk+3 ) − φ(nk+1 ))}
{P USH (nk+3 , φ(nk+4 )) , ..., P USH (nr−1 , φ(nr ))}


Next, we assign probabilities to each tree transition in each stage. In selecting these distributions,
we aim to maintain the original HMM’s sensitivity
to target word order:
• Selecting P OP or S TOP is a simple Bernoulli
distribution conditioned upon a node type.
• We model both M OVE and P USH as multinomial distributions over the signed distance in
positions (assuming a starting position of 0 for
P USH), echoing the parameterization popular
in implementations of the HMM model.
This model reduces to the classic HMM distortion model given minimal English trees of only uniformly labeled pre-terminals and a root node. The
classic 0-distance distortion would correspond to the

Figure 3: For this example sentence, the learned distortion distribution of pd (aj |aj− , j, t) resembles its
counterpart pd (aj |aj− , j) of the HMM model but reﬂects the constituent structure of the English tree t.
For instance, the short path from relieve to on gives
a high transition likelihood.
S TOP probability of the pre-terminal label; all other
distances would correspond to M OVE probabilities
conditioned on the root label, and the probability of
transitioning to the terminal state would correspond
to the P OP probability of the root label.
As in a multinomial-distortion implementation of
the classic HMM model, we must sometimes artiﬁcially normalize these distributions in the deﬁcient
case that certain jumps extend beyond the ends of
the local rules. For this reason, M OVE and P USH
are actually parameterized by three values: a node
type, a signed distance, and a range of options that
dictates a normalization adjustment.
Once each tree transition generates a score, their
product gives the probability of the entire path, and
thereby the cost of the transition between string positions. Figure 3 shows an example learned distribution that reﬂects the structure of the given parse.
With these derivation steps in place, we must address a handful of special cases to complete the generative model. We require that the Markov walk
from leaf to leaf of the English tree must start and
end at the root, using the following assumptions.
1. Given no previous alignment, we forego stages

3. If the ﬁrst choice in stage 1 is to S TOP at the
current leaf, then stage 2 and 3 are unnecessary. Hence, a choice to S TOP immediately is
a choice to emit another foreign word from the
current English word.
4. We ﬂatten unary transitions from the tree when
computing distortion probabilities.
5. Null alignments are treated just as in the HMM
model, incurring a ﬁxed cost from any position.
This model can be simpliﬁed by removing all conditioning on node types. However, we found this
variant to slightly underperform the full model described above. Intuitively, types carry information
about cross-linguistic ordering preferences.
3.2

Training Approach

Because our model largely mirrors the generative process and structure of the original HMM
model, we apply a nearly identical training procedure to ﬁt the parameters to the training data via the
Expectation-Maximization algorithm. Och and Ney
(2003) gives a detailed exposition of the technique.
In the E-step, we employ the forward-backward
algorithm and current parameters to ﬁnd expected
counts for each potential pair of links in each training pair. In this familiar dynamic programming approach, we must compute the distortion probabilities
for each pair of English positions.
The minimal path between two leaves in a tree can
be computed efﬁciently by ﬁrst ﬁnding the path from
the root to each leaf, then comparing those paths to
ﬁnd the nearest common ancestor and a path through
it – requiring time linear in the height of the tree.
Computing distortion costs independently for each
pair of words in the sentence imposed a computational overhead of roughly 50% over the original
HMM model. The bulk of this increase arises from
the fact that distortion probabilities in this model
must be computed for each unique tree, in contrast

to the original HMM which has the same distortion
probabilities for all sentences of a given length.
In the M-step, we re-estimate the parameters of
the model using the expected counts collected during the E-step. All of the component distributions
of our lexical and distortion models are multinomials. Thus, upon assuming these expectations as values for the hidden alignment vectors, we maximize
likelihood of the training data simply by computing relative frequencies for each component multinomial. For the distortion model, an expected count
c(aj , aj− ) is allocated to all tree transitions along the
path ρ(aj− ,aj ,t) . These allocations are summed and
normalized for each tree transition type to complete
re-estimation. The method of re-estimating the lexical model remains unchanged.
Initialization of the lexical model affects performance dramatically. Using the simple but effective
joint training technique of Liang et al. (2006), we
initialized the model with lexical parameters from a
jointly trained implementation of IBM Model 1.
3.3

Improved Posterior Inference

Liang et al. (2006) shows that thresholding the posterior probabilities of alignments improves AER relative to computing Viterbi alignments. That is, we
choose a threshold τ (typically τ = 0.5), and take
a = {(i, j) : p(aj = i|f, e) > τ }.
Posterior thresholding provides computationally
convenient ways to combine multiple alignments,
and bidirectional combination often corrects for
errors in individual directional alignment models.
Liang et al. (2006) suggests a soft intersection of a
model m with a reverse model r (foreign to English)
that thresholds the product of their posteriors at each
position:
a = {(i, j) : pm (aj = i|f, e) · pr (ai = j|f, e) > τ } .
These intersected alignments can be quite sparse,
boosting precision at the expense of recall. We
explore a generalized version to this approach by
varying the function c that combines pm and pr :
a = {(i, j) : c(pm , pr ) > τ }. If c is the max function, we recover the (hard) union of the forward and
reverse posterior alignments. If c is the min function, we recover the (hard) intersection. A novel,

high performing alternative is the soft union, which
we evaluate in the next section:
c(pm , pr ) =

pm (aj = i|f, e) + pr (ai = j|f, e)
.
2

Syntax-alignment compatibility can be further
promoted with a simple posterior decoding heuristic
we call competitive thresholding. Given a threshold
and a matrix c of combined weights for each possible link in an alignment, we include a link (i, j)
only if its weight cij is above-threshold and it is connected to the maximum weighted link in both row i
and column j. That is, only the maximum in each
column and row and a contiguous enclosing span of
above-threshold links are included in the alignment.
3.4

Related Work

This proposed model is not the ﬁrst variant of the
HMM model that incorporates syntax-based distortion. Lopez and Resnik (2005) considers a simpler tree distance distortion model. Daum´ III and
e
Marcu (2005) employs a syntax-aware distortion
model for aligning summaries to documents, but
condition upon the roots of the constituents that are
jumped over during a transition, instead of those that
are visited during a walk through the tree. In the case
of syntactic machine translation, we want to condition on crossing constituent boundaries, even if no
constituents are skipped in the process.

Experimental Results

To understand the behavior of this model, we computed the standard alignment error rate (AER) performance metric.2 We also investigated extractionspeciﬁc metrics: the frequency of interior nodes – a
measure of how often the alignments violate the constituent structure of English parses – and a variant of
the CPER metric of Ayan and Dorr (2006).
We evaluated the performance of our model on
both French-English and Chinese-English manually
aligned data sets. For Chinese, we trained on the
FBIS corpus and the LDC bilingual dictionary, then
tested on 491 hand-aligned sentences from the 2002

Rule Extraction Results

While its competitive AER certainly speaks to the
potential utility of our syntactic distortion model, we
proposed the model for a different purpose: to minimize the particularly troubling alignment errors that
cross constituent boundaries and violate the structure of English parse trees. We found that while the
HMM and Syntactic models have very similar AER,
they make substantially different errors.
To investigate the differences, we measured the
degree to which each set of alignments violated the
supplied parse trees, by counting the frequency of
interior nodes that are not null aligned. Figure 4
summarizes the results of the experiment for French:
the Syntactic distortion with competitive thresholding reduces tree violations substantially. Interior
node frequency is reduced by 56% overall, with
the most dramatic improvement observed for clausal
constituents. We observed a similar 50% reduction
for the Chinese data.
Additionally, we evaluated our model with the
transducer analog to the consistent phrase error rate
(CPER) metric of Ayan and Dorr (2006). This evaluation computes precision, recall, and F1 of the rules
extracted under a proposed alignment, relative to the
rules extracted under the gold-standard sure alignments. Table 3 shows improvements in F1 by using

Conclusion

In light of the need to reconcile word alignments
with phrase structure trees for syntactic MT, we have
proposed an HMM-like model whose distortion is
sensitive to such trees. Our model substantially reduces the number of interior nodes in the aligned
corpus and improves rule extraction while nearly
retaining the speed and alignment accuracy of the
HMM model. While it remains to be seen whether
these improvements impact ﬁnal translation accuracy, it is reasonable to hope that, all else equal,
alignments which better respect syntactic correspondences will be superior for syntactic MT.
