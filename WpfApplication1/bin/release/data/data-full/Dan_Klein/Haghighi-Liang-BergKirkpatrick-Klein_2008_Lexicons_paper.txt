Abstract
We present a method for learning bilingual
translation lexicons from monolingual corpora. Word types in each language are characterized by purely monolingual features, such
as context counts and orthographic substrings.
Translations are induced using a generative
model based on canonical correlation analysis, which explains the monolingual lexicons
in terms of latent matchings. We show that
high-precision lexicons can be learned in a variety of language pairs and from a range of
corpus types.

Introduction

Current statistical machine translation systems use
parallel corpora to induce translation correspondences, whether those correspondences be at the
level of phrases (Koehn, 2004), treelets (Galley et
al., 2006), or simply single words (Brown et al.,
1994). Although parallel text is plentiful for some
language pairs such as English-Chinese or EnglishArabic, it is scarce or even non-existent for most
others, such as English-Hindi or French-Japanese.
Moreover, parallel text could be scarce for a language pair even if monolingual data is readily available for both languages.
In this paper, we consider the problem of learning
translations from monolingual sources alone. This
task, though clearly more difﬁcult than the standard
parallel text approach, can operate on language pairs
and in domains where standard approaches cannot.
We take as input two monolingual corpora and perhaps some seed translations, and we produce as output a bilingual lexicon, deﬁned as a list of word

pairs deemed to be word-level translations. Precision and recall are then measured over these bilingual lexicons. This setting has been considered before, most notably in Koehn and Knight (2002) and
Fung (1995), but the current paper is the ﬁrst to use
a probabilistic model and present results across a variety of language pairs and data conditions.
In our method, we represent each language as a
monolingual lexicon (see ﬁgure 2): a list of word
types characterized by monolingual feature vectors,
such as context counts, orthographic substrings, and
so on (section 5). We deﬁne a generative model over
(1) a source lexicon, (2) a target lexicon, and (3) a
matching between them (section 2). Our model is
based on canonical correlation analysis (CCA)1 and
explains matched word pairs via vectors in a common latent space. Inference in the model is done
using an EM-style algorithm (section 3).
Somewhat surprisingly, we show that it is possible to learn or extend a translation lexicon using monolingual corpora alone, in a variety of languages and using a variety of corpora, even in the
absence of orthographic features. As might be expected, the task is harder when no seed lexicon is
provided, when the languages are strongly divergent, or when the monolingual corpora are from different domains. Nonetheless, even in the more difﬁcult cases, a sizable set of high-precision translations
can be extracted. As an example of the performance
of the system, in English-Spanish induction with our
best feature set, using corpora derived from topically
similar but non-parallel sources, the system obtains
89.0% precision at 33% recall.

Bilingual Lexicon Induction

As input, we are given a monolingual corpus S (a
sequence of word tokens) in a source language and
a monolingual corpus T in a target language. Let
s = (s1 , . . . , snS ) denote nS word types appearing
in the source language, and t = (t1 , . . . , tnT ) denote
word types in the target language. Based on S and
T , our goal is to output a matching m between s
and t. We represent m as a set of integer pairs so
that (i, j) ∈ m if and only if si is matched with tj .
2.1

Generative Model

We propose the following generative model over
matchings m and word types (s, t), which we call
matching canonical correlation analysis (MCCA).
MCCA model
m ∼ M ATCHING -P RIOR
[matching m]
For each matched edge (i, j) ∈ m:
−zi,j ∼ N (0, Id )
[latent concept]
−fS (si ) ∼ N (WS zi,j , ΨS )
[source features]
−fT (ti ) ∼ N (WT zi,j , ΨT )
[target features]
For each unmatched source word type i:
−fS (si ) ∼ N (0, σ 2 IdS )
[source features]
For each unmatched target word type j:
−fT (tj ) ∼ N (0, σ 2 IdT )
[target features]

First, we generate a matching m ∈ M, where M
is the set of matchings in which each word type is

matched to at most one other word type.2 We take
M ATCHING -P RIOR to be uniform over M.3
Then, for each matched pair of word types (i, j) ∈
m, we need to generate the observed feature vectors
of the source and target word types, fS (si ) ∈ RdS
and fT (tj ) ∈ RdT . The feature vector of each word
type is computed from the appropriate monolingual corpus and summarizes the word’s monolingual
characteristics; see section 5 for details and ﬁgure 2
for an illustration. Since si and tj are translations of
each other, we expect fS (si ) and fT (tj ) to be connected somehow by the generative process. In our
model, they are related through a vector zi,j ∈ Rd
representing the shared, language-independent concept.
Speciﬁcally, to generate the feature vectors, we
ﬁrst generate a random concept zi,j ∼ N (0, Id ),
where Id is the d × d identity matrix. The source
feature vector fS (si ) is drawn from a multivariate Gaussian with mean WS zi,j and covariance ΨS ,
where WS is a dS × d matrix which transforms the
language-independent concept zi,j into a languagedependent vector in the source space. The arbitrary
covariance parameter ΨS
0 explains the sourcespeciﬁc variations which are not captured by WS ; it
does not play an explicit role in inference. The target
fT (tj ) is generated analogously using WT and ΨT ,
conditionally independent of the source given zi,j
(see ﬁgure 2). For each of the remaining unmatched
source word types si which have not yet been generated, we draw the word type features from a baseline normal distribution with variance σ 2 IdS , with
hyperparameter σ 2
0; unmatched target words
are similarly generated.
If two word types are truly translations, it will be
better to relate their feature vectors through the latent space than to explain them independently via
the baseline distribution. However, if a source word
type is not a translation of any of the target word
types, we can just generate it independently without
requiring it to participate in the matching.
2
Our choice of M permits unmatched word types, but does
not allow words to have multiple translations. This setting facilitates comparison to previous work and admits simpler models.

However, non-uniform priors could encode useful information, such as rank similarities.

Inference

Given our probabilistic model, we would like to
maximize the log-likelihood of the observed data
(s, t):
(θ) = log p(s, t; θ) = log

p(m, s, t; θ)
m

with respect to the model parameters θ =
(WS , WT , ΨS , ΨT ).
We use the hard (Viterbi) EM algorithm as a starting point, but due to modeling and computational
considerations, we make several important modiﬁcations, which we describe later. The general form
of our algorithm is as follows:
Summary of learning algorithm
E-step: Find the maximum weighted (partial) bipartite matching m ∈ M
M-step: Find the best parameters θ by performing
canonical correlation analysis (CCA)

M-step Given a matching m, the M-step optimizes log p(m, s, t; θ) with respect to θ, which can
be rewritten as
max
θ

log p(si , tj ; θ).

RdS ×d of the source and UT ∈ RdT ×d of the target such that the components of the projections
US fS (si ) and UT fT (tj ) are maximally correlated.4
US and UT can be found by solving an eigenvalue
problem (see Hardoon et al. (2003) for details).
Then the maximum likelihood estimates are as follows: WS = CSS US P 1/2 , WT = CT T UT P 1/2 ,
ΨS = CSS − WS WS , and ΨT = CT T − WT WT ,
where P is a d × d diagonal matrix of the canonical
1
correlations, CSS = |m| (i,j)∈m fS (si )fS (si ) is
the empirical covariance matrix in the source domain, and CT T is deﬁned analogously.
E-step To perform a conventional E-step, we
would need to compute the posterior over all matchings, which is #P-complete (Valiant, 1979). On the
other hand, hard EM only requires us to compute the
best matching under the current model:5
m = argmax log p(m , s, t; θ).

We cast this optimization as a maximum weighted
bipartite matching problem as follows. Deﬁne the
edge weight between source word type i and target
word type j to be
wi,j = log p(si , tj ; θ)

(1)

(3)

− log p(si ; θ) − log p(tj ; θ),

(i,j)∈m

This objective corresponds exactly to maximizing
the likelihood of the probabilistic CCA model presented in Bach and Jordan (2006), which proved
that the maximum likelihood estimate can be computed by canonical correlation analysis (CCA). Intuitively, CCA ﬁnds d-dimensional subspaces US ∈

(2)

m

Since dS and dT can be quite large in practice and often greater than |m|, we use Cholesky decomposition to rerepresent the feature vectors as |m|-dimensional vectors with
the same dot products, which is all that CCA depends on.
5
If we wanted softer estimates, we could use the agreementbased learning framework of Liang et al. (2008) to combine two
tractable models.

which can be loosely viewed as a pointwise mutual
information quantity. We can check that the objective log p(m, s, t; θ) is equal to the weight of a
matching plus some constant C:
wi,j + C.

this section, we describe the data and experimental
methodology used throughout this work.

Data

(4)

Each experiment requires a source and target monolingual corpus. We use the following corpora:

To ﬁnd the optimal partial matching, edges with
weight wi,j < 0 are set to zero in the graph and the
optimal full matching is computed in O((nS +nT )3 )
time using the Hungarian algorithm (Kuhn, 1955). If
a zero edge is present in the solution, we remove the
involved word types from the matching.6

• EN-ES-W: 3,851 Wikipedia articles with both
English and Spanish bodies (generally not direct translations).

Bootstrapping Recall that the E-step produces a
partial matching of the word types. If too few
word types are matched, learning will not progress
quickly; if too many are matched, the model will be
swamped with noise. We found that it was helpful
to explicitly control the number of edges. Thus, we
adopt a bootstrapping-style approach that only permits high conﬁdence edges at ﬁrst, and then slowly
permits more over time. In particular, we compute
the optimal full matching, but only retain the highest weighted edges. As we run EM, we gradually
increase the number of edges to retain.
In our context, bootstrapping has a similar motivation to the annealing approach of Smith and Eisner
(2006), which also tries to alter the space of hidden
outputs in the E-step over time to facilitate learning in the M-step, though of course the use of bootstrapping in general is quite widespread (Yarowsky,
1995).

• EN-ES(FR)-D: English: 1st 50k sentences of
Europarl; Spanish (French): 2nd 50k sentences
of Europarl.7

Note that even when corpora are derived from parallel sources, no explicit use is ever made of document or sentence-level alignments. In particular, our
method is robust to permutations of the sentences in
the corpora.

Empirically, we obtained much better efﬁciency and even
increased accuracy by replacing these marginal likelihood
weights with a simple proxy, the distances between the words’
mean latent concepts:

• EN-CH-D: English: 1st 50k sentences of Xinhua parallel news corpora;8 Chinese: 2nd 50k
sentences.
• EN-AR-D: English: 1st 50k sentences of 1994
proceedings of UN parallel corpora;9 Arabic: 2nd 50k sentences.
• EN-ES-G: English: 100k sentences of English
Gigaword; Spanish: 100k sentences of Spanish
Gigaword.10

Each experiment requires a lexicon for evaluation.
Following Koehn and Knight (2002), we consider
lexicons over only noun word types, although this
is not a fundamental limitation of our model. We
consider a word type to be a noun if its most common tag is a noun in our monolingual corpus.11 For

accuracy may not be an accident: whether two words are translations is perhaps better characterized directly by how close
their latent concepts are, whereas log-probability is more sensitive to perturbations in the source and target spaces.

all languages pairs except English-Arabic, we extract evaluation lexicons from the Wiktionary online dictionary. As we discuss in section 7, our extracted lexicons have low coverage, particularly for
proper nouns, and thus all performance measures are
(sometimes substantially) pessimistic. For EnglishArabic, we extract a lexicon from 100k parallel sentences of UN parallel corpora by running the HMM
intersected alignment model (Liang et al., 2008),
adding (s, t) to the lexicon if s was aligned to t at
least three times and more than any other word.
Also, as in Koehn and Knight (2002), we make
use of a seed lexicon, which consists of a small, and
perhaps incorrect, set of initial translation pairs. We
used two methods to derive a seed lexicon. The
ﬁrst is to use the evaluation lexicon Le and select
the hundred most common noun word types in the
source corpus which have translations in Le . The
second method is to heuristically induce, where applicable, a seed lexicon using edit distance, as is
done in Koehn and Knight (2002). Section 6.2 compares the performance of these two methods.
4.3

Evaluation

We evaluate a proposed lexicon Lp against the evaluation lexicon Le using the F1 measure in the standard fashion; precision is given by the number of
proposed translations contained in the evaluation
lexicon, and recall is given by the fraction of possible translation pairs proposed.12 Since our model
12

We should note that precision is not penalized for (s, t) if
s does not have a translation in Le , and recall is not penalized
for failing to recover multiple translations of s.

naturally produces lexicons in which each entry is
associated with a weight based on the model, we can
give a full precision/recall curve (see ﬁgure 3). We
summarize these curves with both the best F1 over
all possible thresholds and various precisions px at
recalls x. All reported numbers exclude evaluation
on the seed lexicon entries, regardless of how those
seeds are derived or whether they are correct.
In all experiments, unless noted otherwise, we
used a seed of size 100 obtained from Le and
considered lexicons between the top n = 2, 000
most frequent source and target noun word types
which were not in the seed lexicon; each system
proposed an already-ranked one-to-one translation
lexicon amongst these n words. Where applicable, we compare against the E DIT D IST baseline,
which solves a maximum bipartite matching problem where edge weights are normalized edit distances. We will use MCCA (for matching CCA) to
denote our model using the optimal feature set (see
section 5.3).

Features

In this section, we explore feature representations of
word types in our model. Recall that fS (·) and fT (·)
map source and target word types to vectors in RdS
and RdT , respectively (see section 2). The features
used in each representation are deﬁned identically
and derived only from the appropriate monolingual
corpora. For a concrete example of a word type to
feature vector mapping, see ﬁgure 2.
5.1

Orthographic Features

For closely related languages, such as English and
Spanish, translation pairs often share many orthographic features. One direct way to capture orthographic similarity between word pairs is edit distance. Running E DIT D IST (see section 4.3) on EN-

ES-W yielded 61.1 p0.33 , but precision quickly degrades for higher recall levels (see E DIT D IST in ta-

Combining Features

We can of course combine context and orthographic
features. Doing so yielded 89.03 p0.33 (labeled
MCCA in table 1); this represents a 46.4% error reduction in p0.33 over the E DIT D IST baseline. For the
remainder of this work, we will use MCCA to refer

It is important to emphasize, however, that our current
model does not directly relate a word type’s role as a participant in the matching to that word’s role as a context feature.

Context Features

While orthographic features are clearly effective for
historically related language pairs, they are more
limited for other language pairs, where we need to
appeal to other clues. One non-orthographic clue
that word types s and t form a translation pair is
that there is a strong correlation between the source
words used with s and the target words used with t.
To capture this information, we deﬁne context features for each word type w, consisting of counts of
nouns which occur within a window of size 4 around
w. Consider the translation pair (time, tiempo)
illustrated in ﬁgure 2. As we become more conﬁdent about other translation pairs which have active period and periodico context features, we
learn that translation pairs tend to jointly generate
these features, which leads us to believe that time
and tiempo might be generated by a common underlying concept vector (see section 2).13
Using context features alone on EN-ES-W, our
MCCA model (labeled C ONTEXT in table 1) yielded
a 80.2 p0.33 . It is perhaps surprising that context features alone, without orthographic information, can
yield a best-F1 comparable to E DIT D IST.

ble 1). Nevertheless, when available, orthographic
clues are strong indicators of translation pairs.
We can represent orthographic features of a word
type w by assigning a feature to each substring of
length ≤ 3. Note that MCCA can learn regular orthographic correspondences between source and target words, which is something edit distance cannot
capture (see table 5). Indeed, running our MCCA
model with only orthographic features on EN-ESW, labeled O RTHO in table 1, yielded 80.1 p0.33 , a
31% error-reduction over E DIT D IST in p0.33 .

Experiments

In this section we examine how system performance
varies when crucial elements are altered.
6.1

Corpus Variation

There are many sources from which we can derive
monolingual corpora, and MCCA performance depends on the degree of similarity between corpora.
We explored the following levels of relationships between corpora, roughly in order of closest to most
distant:
• Same Sentences: EN-ES-P
• Non-Parallel Similar Content: EN-ES-W
• Distinct Sentences, Same Domain: EN-ES-D
• Unrelated Corpora: EN-ES-G
Our results for all conditions are presented in table 2(a). The predominant trend is that system performance degraded when the corpora diverged in

content, presumably due to context features becoming less informative. However, it is notable that even
in the most extreme case of disjoint corpora from
different time periods and topics (e.g. EN-ES-G),
we are still able to recover lexicons of reasonable
accuracy.

Seed Lexicon Variation

All of our experiments so far have exploited a small
seed lexicon which has been derived from the evaluation lexicon (see section 4.3). In order to explore
system robustness to heuristically chosen seed lexicons, we automatically extracted a seed lexicon similarly to Koehn and Knight (2002): we ran E DITD IST on EN-ES-D and took the top 100 most conﬁdent translation pairs. Using this automatically derived seed lexicon, we ran our system on EN-ESD as before, evaluating on the top 2,000 noun word
types not included in the automatic lexicon.14 Using the automated seed lexicon, and still evaluating against our Wiktionary lexicon, MCCA-AUTO
yielded 91.8 p0.33 (see table 2(b)), indicating that
our system can produce lexicons of comparable accuracy with a heuristically chosen seed. We should
note that this performance represents no knowledge
given to the system in the form of gold seed lexicon
entries.
6.3

Language Variation

We also explored how system performance varies
for language pairs other than English-Spanish. On
English-French, for the disjoint EN-FR-D corpus
(described in section 4.1), MCCA yielded 88.3 p0.33
(see table 2(c) for more performance measures).
This veriﬁed that our model can work for another
closely related language-pair on which no model development was performed.
One concern is how our system performs on language pairs where orthographic features are less applicable. Results on disjoint English-Chinese and
English-Arabic are given as EN-CH-D and EN-AR
in table 2(c), both using only context features. In
these cases, MCCA yielded much lower precisions
of 26.8 and 31.0 p0.33 , respectively. For both languages, performance degraded compared to EN-ES14

Note that the 2,000 words evaluated here were not identical
to the words tested on when the seed lexicon is derived from the
evaluation lexicon.

Comparison To Previous Work

There has been previous work in extracting translation pairs from non-parallel corpora (Rapp, 1995;
Fung, 1995; Koehn and Knight, 2002), but generally not in as extreme a setting as the one considered here. Due to unavailability of data and speciﬁcity in experimental conditions and evaluations, it
is not possible to perform exact comparisons. How-

ever, we attempted to run an experiment as similar
as possible in setup to Koehn and Knight (2002), using English Gigaword and German Europarl. In this
setting, our MCCA system yielded 61.7% accuracy
on the 186 most conﬁdent predictions compared to
39% reported in Koehn and Knight (2002).

Analysis

We have presented a novel generative model for
bilingual lexicon induction and presented results under a variety of data conditions (section 6.1) and languages (section 6.3) showing that our system can
produce accurate lexicons even in highly adverse
conditions. In this section, we broadly characterize
and analyze the behavior of our system.
We manually examined the top 100 errors in the

English-Spanish lexicon produced by our system
on EN-ES-W. Of the top 100 errors: 21 were correct translations not contained in the Wiktionary
lexicon (e.g. pintura to painting), 4 were
purely morphological errors (e.g. airport to
aeropuertos), 30 were semantically related (e.g.
basketball to b´isbol), 15 were words with
e
strong orthographic similarities (e.g. coast to
costas), and 30 were difﬁcult to categorize and
fell into none of these categories. Since many of
our ‘errors’ actually represent valid translation pairs
not contained in our extracted dictionary, we supplemented our evaluation lexicon with one automatically derived from 100k sentences of parallel Europarl data. We ran the intersected HMM wordalignment model (Liang et al., 2008) and added
(s, t) to the lexicon if s was aligned to t at least
three times and more than any other word. Evaluating against the union of these lexicons yielded 98.0
p0.33 , a signiﬁcant improvement over the 92.3 using only the Wiktionary lexicon. Of the true errors,
the most common arose from semantically related
words which had strong context feature correlations
(see table 4(b)).
We also explored the relationships our model
learns between features of different languages. We
projected each source and target feature into the
shared canonical space, and for each projected
source feature we examined the closest projected
target features. In table 5(a), we present some of
the orthographic feature relationships learned by our
system. Many of these relationships correspond to
phonological and morphological regularities such as
the English sufﬁx ing mapping to the Spanish sufﬁx g´a. In table 5(b), we present context feature
ı
correspondences. Here, the broad trend is for words
which are either translations or semantically related
across languages to be close in canonical space.

Conclusion

We have presented a generative model for bilingual
lexicon induction based on probabilistic CCA. Our
experiments show that high-precision translations
can be mined without any access to parallel corpora.
It remains to be seen how such lexicons can be best
utilized, but they invite new approaches to the statistical translation of resource-poor languages.
