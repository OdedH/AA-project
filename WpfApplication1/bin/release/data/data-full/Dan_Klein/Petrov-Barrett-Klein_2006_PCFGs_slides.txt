Non-Local Modeling with a Mixture of PCFGs

Capturing Rule Correlations

Mixture model captures non-local correlations.
10% reduction in total correlation error:
Estimate rule correlations from corpus.
Generate trees with grammar and estimate rule
correlations.
Compute correlation difference.

Non-Local Modeling with a Mixture of PCFGs

Genre
Brown corpus’ genres are statistically coherent.
Assign each genre to an individual grammar (no EM
training):
F1 = 79.48, LL=-242332.
Initialize by genre then train with EM:
F1 = 79.37, LL=-242100.
EM with a random initialization:
F1 = 79.16, LL=-242459.
Model can capture variation between genres, but
maximum training data likelihood does not
necessarily give maximum accuracy.

Recent Development

"Learning Accurate, Compact, and Interpretable Tree
Annotation", Petrov et al., ACL 2006:
F1 = 90.2%.
More ﬂexible learning framework.
Split and merge training to keep grammar compact.
Similar in spirit to Klein & Manning 2003 and
Matsuzaki et al. 2005.

Non-Local Modeling with a Mixture of PCFGs

Conclusions

Examined rule correlations that may be found in
natural language corpora, discovering non-local
correlations not captured by traditional models.
A Mixture of PCFGs can represent these non-local
features and gives an improvement in parsing
accuracy and data likelihood.
This improvement is modest, however, primarily
because local correlations are so much stronger than
non-local ones.
