Abstract
We present a discriminative model that directly predicts which set of phrasal translation rules should be extracted from a sentence pair. Our model scores extraction
sets: nested collections of all the overlapping phrase pairs consistent with an underlying word alignment. Extraction set models provide two principle advantages over
word-factored alignment models. First,
we can incorporate features on phrase
pairs, in addition to word links. Second,
we can optimize for an extraction-based
loss function that relates directly to the
end task of generating translations. Our
model gives improvements in alignment
quality relative to state-of-the-art unsupervised and supervised baselines, as well
as providing up to a 1.4 improvement in
BLEU score in Chinese-to-English translation experiments.

Introduction

In the last decade, the ﬁeld of statistical machine
translation has shifted from generating sentences
word by word to systems that recycle whole fragments of training examples, expressed as translation rules. This general paradigm was ﬁrst pursued using contiguous phrases (Och et al., 1999;
Koehn et al., 2003), and has since been generalized to a wide variety of hierarchical and syntactic
formalisms. The training stage of statistical systems focuses primarily on discovering translation
rules in parallel corpora.
Most systems discover translation rules via a
two-stage pipeline: a parallel corpus is aligned at
the word level, and then a second procedure extracts fragment-level rules from word-aligned sentence pairs. This paper offers a model-based alternative to phrasal rule extraction, which merges this

two-stage pipeline into a single step. We present a
discriminative model that directly predicts which
set of phrasal translation rules should be extracted
from a sentence pair. Our model predicts extraction sets: combinatorial objects that include the
set of all overlapping phrasal translation rules consistent with an underlying word-level alignment.
This approach provides additional discriminative
power relative to word aligners because extraction
sets are scored based on the phrasal rules they contain in addition to word-to-word alignment links.
Moreover, the structure of our model directly reﬂects the purpose of alignment models in general,
which is to discover translation rules.
We address several challenges to training and
applying an extraction set model. First, we would
like to leverage existing word-level alignment resources. To do so, we deﬁne a deterministic mapping from word alignments to extraction sets, inspired by existing extraction procedures. In our
mapping, possible alignment links have a precise
interpretation that dictates what phrasal translation
rules can be extracted from a sentence pair. This
mapping allows us to train with existing annotated
data sets and use the predictions from word-level
aligners as features in our extraction set model.
Second, our model solves a structured prediction problem, and the choice of loss function during training affects model performance. We optimize for a phrase-level F-measure in order to focus learning on the task of predicting phrasal rules
rather than word alignment links.
Third, our discriminative approach requires that
we perform inference in the space of extraction
sets. Our model does not factor over disjoint wordto-word links or minimal phrase pairs, and so existing inference procedures do not directly apply.
However, we show that the dynamic program for
a block ITG aligner can be augmented to score extraction sets that are indexed by underlying ITG
word alignments (Wu, 1997). We also describe a

Extraction Set Models

The input to our model is an unaligned sentence
pair, and the output is an extraction set of phrasal
translation rules. Word-level alignments are generated as a byproduct of inference. We ﬁrst specify the relationship between word alignments and
extraction sets, then deﬁne our model.
2.1

Extraction Sets from Word Alignments

Rule extraction is a standard concept in machine
translation: word alignment constellations license
particular sets of overlapping rules, from which
subsets are selected according to limits on phrase
length (Koehn et al., 2003), number of gaps (Chiang, 2007), count of internal tree nodes (Galley et
al., 2006), etc. In this paper, we focus on phrasal
rule extraction (i.e., phrase pair extraction), upon
which most other extraction procedures are based.
Given a sentence pair (e, f), phrasal rule extraction deﬁnes a mapping from a set of word-to-word

and likewise each word fj projects to a span of e.
Then, Rn (A) includes a bispan [g, h) ⇔ [k, ) iff
σ(ei ) ⊆ [k, )

∀i ∈ [g, h)

σ(fj ) ⊆ [g, h)

∀j ∈ [k, )

That is, every word in one of the phrasal spans
must project within the other. This mapping is deterministic, and so we can interpret a word-level
alignment A as also specifying the phrasal rules
that should be extracted from a sentence pair.
2.2

Possible and Null Alignment Links

We have not yet accounted for two special cases
in annotated corpora: possible alignments and null
alignments. To analyze these annotations, we consider a particular data set: a hand-aligned portion
1
We use the fencepost indexing scheme used commonly
for parsing. Words are 0-indexed. Spans are inclusive on the
lower bound and exclusive on the upper bound. For example,
the span [0, 2) includes the ﬁrst two words of a sentence.

of the NIST MT02 Chinese-to-English test set,
which has been used in previous alignment experiments (Ayan et al., 2005; DeNero and Klein, 2007;
Haghighi et al., 2009).
Possible links account for 22% of all alignment
links in these data, and we found that most of
these links fall into two categories. First, possible
links are used to align function words that have no

of words participate in some alignment link. The
unaligned words typically express content in one
sentence that is absent in its translation.
Figure 3 illustrates how we interpret possible
and null links in our projection. Possible links are
typically not included in extraction procedures because most aligners predict only sure links. However, we see a natural interpretation for possible
links in rule extraction: they license phrasal rules
that both include and exclude them. We exclude
null alignments from extracted phrases because
they often indicate a mismatch in content.
We achieve these effects by redeﬁning the projection operator σ. Let A(s) be the subset of A
that are sure links, then let the index set Ji used
for projection σ in Equation 1 be

 j : (i, j) ∈ A(s)
if ∃j : (i, j) ∈ A(s)

Ji = {−1, |f|}
if j : (i, j) ∈ A


{j : (i, j) ∈ A}
otherwise
Here, Ji is a set of integers, and σ(ei ) for null
aligned ei will be [−1, |f| + 1) by Equation 1.
Of course, the characteristics of our aligned corpus may not hold for other annotated corpora or
other language pairs. However, we hope that the
overall effectiveness of our modeling approach
will inﬂuence future annotation efforts to build
corpora that are consistent with this interpretation.

Figure 3: Possible links constrain the word-tophrase projection of otherwise unaligned words,
which in turn license overlapping phrases. In this
example, σ(f2 ) = [1, 2) does not include the
possible link at (1, 0) because of the sure link at
(1, 1), but σ(e1 ) = [1, 2) does use the possible

herent extraction sets Rn (A), those that are licensed by an underlying word alignment A with
sure alignments A(s) ⊆ A. Conditioned on a
sentence pair (e, f) and maximum phrase length
n, we score extraction sets via a feature vector φ(A(s) , Rn (A)) that includes features on sure
links (i, j) ∈ A(s) and features on the bispans in
Rn (A) that link [g, h) in e to [k, ) in f :
φ(A(s) , Rn (A)) =
φa (i, j) +
(i,j)∈A(s)

[g,h)⇔[k, )∈Rn (A)

Because the projection operator Rn (·) is a
deterministic function, we can abbreviate
φ(A(s) , Rn (A)) as φ(A) without loss of information, although we emphasize that A is a set
of sure and possible alignments, and φ(A) does
not decompose as a sum of vectors on individual
word-level alignment links. Our model is parameterized by a weight vector θ, which scores an
extraction set Rn (A) as θ · φ(A).
To further limit the space of extraction sets we
are willing to consider, we restrict A to block
inverse transduction grammar (ITG) alignments,
a space that allows many-to-many alignments
through phrasal terminal productions, but otherwise enforces at-most-one-to-one phrase matchings with ITG reordering patterns (Cherry and Lin,
2007; Zhang et al., 2008). The ITG constraint

ITG alignments is expressive enough to include
[past tense] the vast majority of patterns observed in handannotated parallel corpora (Haghighi et al., 2009).
In summary, our model scores all Rn (A) for
A ∈ ITG(e, f) where A can include block terminals of size up to n. In our experiments, n = 3.
Unlike previous work, we allow possible alignment links to appear in the block terminals, as depicted in Figure 4.

Model Estimation

We estimate the weights θ of our extraction set
model discriminatively using the margin-infused
relaxed algorithm (MIRA) of Crammer and Singer
(2003)—a large-margin, perceptron-style, online
learning algorithm. MIRA has been used successfully in MT to estimate both alignment models (Haghighi et al., 2009) and translation models
(Chiang et al., 2008).
For each training example, MIRA requires that
we ﬁnd the alignment Am corresponding to the
highest scoring extraction set Rn (Am ) under the
current model,
Am = arg maxA∈ITG(e,f) θ · φ(A)

Section 4 describes our approach to solving this
search problem for model inference.
MIRA updates away from Rn (Am ) and toward a gold extraction set Rn (Ag ). Some handannotated alignments are outside of the block ITG

we prefer Ag to Am by a margin greater than

We train the model for 30 iterations over the
training set, shufﬂing the order each time, and we
average the weight vectors observed after each iteration to estimate our ﬁnal model.
3.1

Extraction Set Loss Function

In order to focus learning on predicting the
right bispans, we use an extraction-level loss
L(Am ; Ag ): an F-measure of the overlap between
bispans in Rn (Am ) and Rn (Ag ). This measure
has been proposed previously to evaluate alignment systems (Ayan and Dorr, 2006). Based
on preliminary translation results during development, we chose bispan F5 as our loss:
Pr(Am ) = |Rn (Am ) ∩ Rn (Ag )|/|Rn (Am )|
Rc(Am ) = |Rn (Am ) ∩ Rn (Ag )|/|Rn (Ag )|
(1 + 52 ) · Pr(Am ) · Rc(Am )
52 · Pr(Am ) + Rc(Am )
L(Am ; Ag ) = 1 − F5 (Am ; Ag )

F5 (Am ; Ag ) =

F5 favors recall over precision. Previous alignment work has shown improvements from adjusting the F-measure parameter (Fraser and Marcu,
2006). In particular, Lacoste-Julien et al. (2006)
also chose a recall-biased objective.
Optimizing for a bispan F-measure penalizes
alignment mistakes in proportion to their rule extraction consequences. That is, adding a word
link that prevents the extraction of many correct
phrasal rules, or which licenses many incorrect
rules, is strongly discouraged by this loss.

Features on Extraction Sets

The discriminative power of our model is driven
by the features on sure word alignment links
φa (i, j) and bispans φb (g, h, k, ). In both cases,
the most important features come from the predictions of unsupervised models trained on large
parallel corpora, which provide frequency and cooccurrence information.
To score word-to-word links, we use the posterior predictions of a jointly trained HMM alignment model (Liang et al., 2006). The remaining
features include a dictionary feature, an identical
word feature, an absolute position distortion feature, and features for numbers and punctuation.
To score phrasal translation rules in an extraction set, we use a mixture of feature types. Extraction set models allow us to incorporate the
same phrasal relative frequency statistics that drive
phrase-based translation performance (Koehn et
al., 2003). To implement these frequency features,
we extract a phrase table from the alignment predictions of a jointly trained unsupervised HMM
model using Moses (Koehn et al., 2007), and score
bispans using the resulting features. We also include indicator features on lexical templates for
the 50 most common words in each language, as
in Haghighi et al. (2009). We include indicators
for the number of words and Chinese characters
in rules. One useful indicator feature exploits the
fact that capitalized terms in English tend to align
to Chinese words with three or more characters.
On 1-by-n or n-by-1 phrasal rules, we include indicator features of fertility for common words.3
We also include monolingual phrase features
that expose useful information to the model. For
instance, English bigrams beginning with “the”
are often extractable phrases. English trigrams
with a hyphen as the second word are typically extractable, meaning that the ﬁrst and third words
align to consecutive Chinese words. When any
conjugation of the word “to be” is followed by a
verb, indicating passive voice or progressive tense,
the two words tend to align together.
Our feature set also includes bias features on
phrasal rules and links, which control the number of null-aligned words and number of rules licensed. In total, our ﬁnal model includes 4,249
individual features, dominated by various instantiations of lexical templates.

Limiting lexicalized features to common words helps
prevent overﬁtting.

If we treat the maximum phrase length n as a ﬁxed

search the space of extraction sets. An ITG derivation for some alignment A decomposes into two
sub-derivations for AL and AR .4 The model score
of A, which scores extraction set Rn (A), decomposes over AL and AR , along with any phrasal

same score, and we only compute the max, not the sum.

Our algorithm easily extends to include null alignments, but

Relationship to Previous Work

Our model is certainly not the ﬁrst alignment approach to include structures larger than words.
Model-based phrase-to-phrase alignment was proposed early in the history of phrase-based translation as a method for training translation models
(Marcu and Wong, 2002). A variety of unsupervised models reﬁned this initial work with priors
(DeNero et al., 2008; Blunsom et al., 2009) and
inference constraints (DeNero et al., 2006; Birch
et al., 2006; Cherry and Lin, 2007; Zhang et al.,
2008). These models fundamentally differ from
ours in that they stipulate a segmentation of the
sentence pair into phrases, and only align the minimal phrases in that segmentation. Our model
scores the larger overlapping phrases that result
from composing these minimal phrases.
Discriminative alignment is also a well-

explored area. Most work has focused on predicting word alignments via partial matching inference algorithms (Melamed, 2000; Taskar et al.,
2005; Moore, 2005; Lacoste-Julien et al., 2006).
Work in semi-supervised estimation has also contributed evidence that hand-annotations are useful
for training alignment models (Fraser and Marcu,
2006; Fraser and Marcu, 2007). The ITG grammar formalism, the corresponding word alignment
class, and inference procedures for the class have
also been explored extensively (Wu, 1997; Zhang
and Gildea, 2005; Cherry and Lin, 2007; Zhang
et al., 2008). At the intersection of these lines of
work, discriminative ITG models have also been
proposed, including one-to-one alignment models (Cherry and Lin, 2006) and block models
(Haghighi et al., 2009). Our model directly extends this research agenda with ﬁrst-class possible links, overlapping phrasal rule features, and an
extraction-level loss function.
K¨ ari¨ inen (2009) trains a translation model
a¨ a
discriminatively using features on overlapping
phrase pairs. That work differs from ours in
that it uses ﬁxed word alignments and focuses on
translation model estimation, while we focus on
alignment and translate using standard relative frequency estimators.
Deng and Zhou (2009) present an alignment
combination technique that uses phrasal features.
Our approach differs in two ways. First, their approach is tightly coupled to the input alignments,
while we perform a full search over the space of
ITG alignments. Also, their approach uses greedy
search, while our search is optimal aside from
pruning and beaming. Despite these differences,
their strong results reinforce our claim that phraselevel information is useful for alignment.

Experiments

We evaluate our extraction set model by the bispans it predicts, the word alignments it generates,
and the translations generated by two end-to-end
systems. Table 1 compares the ﬁve systems described below, including three baselines. All supervised aligners were optimized for bispan F5 .
Unsupervised Baseline: GIZA++. We trained
GIZA++ (Och and Ney, 2003) using the default
parameters included with the Moses training script
(Koehn et al., 2007). The designated regimen concludes by Viterbi aligning under Model 4 in both
directions. We combined these alignments with

the grow-diag heuristic (Koehn et al., 2003).
Unsupervised Baseline: Joint HMM. We
trained and combined two HMM alignment models (Ney and Vogel, 1996) using the Berkeley
Aligner.7 We initialized the HMM model parameters with jointly trained Model 1 parameters (Liang et al., 2006), combined word-toword posteriors by averaging (soft union), and decoded with the competitive thresholding heuristic
of DeNero and Klein (2007), yielding a state-ofthe-art unsupervised baseline.
Supervised Baseline: Block ITG. We discriminatively trained a block ITG aligner with only sure
links, using block terminal productions up to 3
words by 3 words in size. This supervised baseline is a reimplementation of the MIRA-trained
model of Haghighi et al. (2009). We use the same
features and parser implementation for this model
as we do for our extraction set model to ensure a
clean comparison. To remain within the alignment
class, MIRA updates this model toward a pseudogold alignment with only sure links. This model
does not score any overlapping bispans.
Extraction Set Coarse Pass. We add possible
links to the output of the block ITG model by
adding the mixed terminal block productions described in Section 2.3. This model scores overlapping phrasal rules contained within terminal
blocks that result from including or excluding possible links. However, this model does not score
bispans that cross bracketing of ITG derivations.
Full Extraction Set Model. Our full model includes possible links and features on extraction
sets for phrasal bispans with a maximum size of
3. Model inference is performed using the coarseto-ﬁne scheme described in Section 4.2.

Data

In this paper, we focus exclusively on Chinese-toEnglish translation. We performed our discriminative training and alignment evaluations using a
hand-aligned portion of the NIST MT02 test set,
which consists of 150 training and 191 test sentences (Ayan and Dorr, 2006). We trained the
baseline HMM on 11.3 million words of FBIS
newswire data, a comparable dataset to those used
in previous alignment evaluations on our test set
(DeNero and Klein, 2007; Haghighi et al., 2009).

Our end-to-end translation experiments were
tuned and evaluated on sentences up to length 40
from the NIST MT04 and MT05 test sets. For
these experiments, we trained on a 22.1 million
word parallel corpus consisting of sentences up to
length 40 of newswire data from the GALE program, subsampled from a larger data set to promote overlap with the tune and test sets. This corpus also includes a bilingual dictionary. To improve performance, we retrained our aligner on a
retokenized version of the hand-annotated data to
match the tokenization of our corpus.8 We trained
a language model with Kneser-Ney smoothing
on 262 million words of newswire using SRILM
(Stolcke, 2002).
6.2

Word and Phrase Alignment

The ﬁrst panel of Table 1 gives a word-level evaluation of all ﬁve aligners. We use the alignment
error rate (AER) measure: precision is the fraction of sure links in the system output that are sure
or possible in the reference, and recall is the fraction of sure links in the reference that the system
outputs as sure. For this evaluation, possible links
produced by our extraction set models are ignored.
The full extraction set model performs the best by
a small margin, although it was not tuned for word
alignment.
The second panel gives a phrasal rule-level
evaluation, which measures the degree to which
these aligners matched the extraction sets of handannotated alignments, R3 (At ).9 To compete
fairly, all models were evaluated on the full extraction sets induced by the word alignments they
predicted. Again, the extraction set model outperformed the baselines, particularly on the F5 measure for which these systems were trained.
Our coarse pass extraction set model performed
nearly as well as the full model. We believe
these models perform similarly for two reasons.
First, most of the information needed to predict
an extraction set can be inferred from word links
and phrasal rules contained within ITG terminal
productions. Second, the coarse-to-ﬁne inference
may be constraining the full phrasal model to predict similar output to the coarse model. This similarity persists in translation experiments.

All alignment results are reported under the annotated
data set’s original tokenization.

While pseudo-gold approximations to the annotation
were used for training, the evaluation is always performed
relative to the original human annotation.

Table 1: Experimental results demonstrate that the full extraction set model outperforms supervised and
unsupervised baselines in evaluations of word alignment quality, extraction set quality, and translation.
In word and bispan evaluations, GIZA++ did not have access to a dictionary while all other methods
did. In the BLEU evaluation, all systems used a bilingual dictionary included in the training corpus. The
BLEU evaluation of supervised systems also included rule counts from the Joint HMM to compensate
for parse failures.
6.3

Translation Experiments

We evaluate the alignments predicted by our
model using two publicly available, open-source,
state-of-the-art translation systems. Moses is a
phrase-based system with lexicalized reordering
(Koehn et al., 2007). Joshua (Li et al., 2009) is
an implementation of Hiero (Chiang, 2007) using
a sufﬁx-array-based grammar extraction approach
(Lopez, 2007).
Both of these systems take word alignments as
input, and neither of these systems accepts possible links in the alignments they consume. To interface with our extraction set models, we produced
three sets of sure-only alignments from our model
predictions: one that omitted possible links, one
that converted all possible links to sure links, and
one that includes each possible link with 0.5 probability. These three sets were aggregated and rules
were extracted from all three.
The training set we used for MT experiments
is quite heterogenous and noisy compared to our
alignment test sets, and the supervised aligners
did not handle certain sentence pairs in our parallel corpus well. In some cases, pruning based
on consistency with the HMM caused parse failures, which in turn caused training sentences to be
skipped. To account for these issues, we added
counts of phrasal rules extracted from the baseline
HMM to the counts produced by supervised aligners.
In Moses, our extraction set model predicts the
set of phrases extracted by the system, and so the
estimation techniques for the alignment model and
translation model both share a common underlying representation: extraction sets. Empirically,
we observe a BLEU score improvement of 1.2

over the best unsupervised baseline and 0.8 over
the block ITG supervised baseline (Papineni et al.,
2002).
In Joshua, hierarchical rule extraction is based
upon phrasal rule extraction, but abstracts away
sub-phrases to create a grammar. Hence, the extraction sets we predict are closely linked to the
representation that this system uses to translate.
The extraction model again outperformed both unsupervised and supervised baselines, by 1.4 BLEU
and 1.2 BLEU respectively.

Conclusion

Our extraction set model serves to coordinate the
alignment and translation model components of a
statistical translation system by unifying their representations. Moreover, our model provides an effective alternative to phrase alignment models that
choose a particular phrase segmentation; instead,
we predict many overlapping phrases, both large
and small, that are mutually consistent. In future
work, we look forward to developing extraction
set models for richer formalisms, including hierarchical grammars.
