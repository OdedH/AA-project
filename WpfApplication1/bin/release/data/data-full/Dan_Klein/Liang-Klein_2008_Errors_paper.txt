Abstract
We identify four types of errors that unsupervised induction systems make and study
each one in turn. Our contributions include
(1) using a meta-model to analyze the incorrect biases of a model in a systematic way,
(2) providing an efﬁcient and robust method
of measuring distance between two parameter
settings of a model, and (3) showing that local optima issues which typically plague EM
can be somewhat alleviated by increasing the
number of training examples. We conduct
our analyses on three models: the HMM, the
PCFG, and a simple dependency model.

Introduction

The unsupervised induction of linguistic structure
from raw text is an important problem both for understanding language acquisition and for building
language processing systems such as parsers from
limited resources. Early work on inducing grammars via EM encountered two serious obstacles: the
inappropriateness of the likelihood objective and the
tendency of EM to get stuck in local optima. Without additional constraints on bracketing (Pereira and
Shabes, 1992) or on allowable rewrite rules (Carroll
and Charniak, 1992), unsupervised grammar learning was ineffective.
Since then, there has been a large body of work
addressing the ﬂaws of the EM-based approach.
Syntactic models empirically more learnable than
PCFGs have been developed (Clark, 2001; Klein
and Manning, 2004). Smith and Eisner (2005) proposed a new objective function; Smith and Eisner (2006) introduced a new training procedure.
Bayesian approaches can also improve performance
(Goldwater and Grifﬁths, 2007; Johnson, 2007;
Kurihara and Sato, 2006).

Though these methods have improved induction
accuracy, at the core they all still involve optimizing
non-convex objective functions related to the likelihood of some model, and thus are not completely
immune to the difﬁculties associated with early approaches. It is therefore important to better understand the behavior of unsupervised induction systems in general.
In this paper, we take a step back and present
a more statistical view of unsupervised learning in
the context of grammar induction. We identify four
types of error that a system can make: approximation, identiﬁability, estimation, and optimization errors (see Figure 1). We try to isolate each one in turn
and study its properties.
Approximation error is caused by a mis-match
between the likelihood objective optimized by EM
and the true relationship between sentences and their
syntactic structures. Our key idea for understanding this mis-match is to “cheat” and initialize EM
with the true relationship and then study the ways
in which EM repurposes our desired syntactic structures to increase likelihood. We present a metamodel of the changes that EM makes and show how
this tool can shed some light on the undesired biases
of the HMM, the PCFG, and the dependency model
with valence (Klein and Manning, 2004).
Identiﬁability error can be incurred when two distinct parameter settings yield the same probability distribution over sentences. One type of nonidentiﬁability present in HMMs and PCFGs is label
symmetry, which even makes computing a meaningful distance between parameters NP-hard. We
present a method to obtain lower and upper bounds
on such a distance.
Estimation error arises from having too few training examples, and optimization error stems from

EM getting stuck in local optima. While it is to be
expected that estimation error should decrease as the
amount of data increases, we show that optimization
error can also decrease. We present striking experiments showing that if our data actually comes from
the model family we are learning with, we can sometimes recover the true parameters by simply running EM without clever initialization. This result
runs counter to the conventional attitude that EM is
doomed to local optima; it suggests that increasing
the amount of data might be an effective way to partially combat local optima.

Unsupervised models

Let x denote an input sentence and y denote the unobserved desired output (e.g., a parse tree). We consider a model family P = {pθ (x, y) : θ ∈ Θ}. For
example, if P is the set of all PCFGs, then the parameters θ would specify all the rule probabilities of
a particular grammar. We sometimes use θ and pθ
interchangeably to simplify notation. In this paper,
we analyze the following three model families:
In the HMM, the input x is a sequence of words
and the output y is the corresponding sequence of
part-of-speech tags.
In the PCFG, the input x is a sequence of POS
tags and the output y is a binary parse tree with yield
x. We represent y as a multiset of binary rewrites of
the form (y → y1 y2 ), where y is a nonterminal and
y1 , y2 can be either nonterminals or terminals.
In the dependency model with valence (DMV)
(Klein and Manning, 2004), the input x =
(x1 , . . . , xm ) is a sequence of POS tags and the output y speciﬁes the directed links of a projective dependency tree. The generative model is as follows:
for each head xi , we generate an independent sequence of arguments to the left and to the right from
a direction-dependent distribution over tags. At each
point, we stop with a probability parametrized by the
direction and whether any arguments have already
been generated in that direction. See Klein and Manning (2004) for a formal description.
In all our experiments, we used the Wall Street
Journal (WSJ) portion of the Penn Treebank. We binarized the PCFG trees and created gold dependency
trees according to the Collins head rules. We trained
45-state HMMs on all 49208 sentences, 11-state

PCFGs on WSJ-10 (7424 sentences) and DMVs
on WSJ-20 (25523 sentences) (Klein and Manning,
2004). We ran EM for 100 iterations with the parameters initialized uniformly (always plus a small
amount of random noise). We evaluated the HMM
and PCFG by mapping model states to Treebank
tags to maximize accuracy.

Decomposition of errors

Now we will describe the four types of errors (Figure 1) more formally. Let p∗ (x, y) denote the distribution which governs the true relationship between
the input x and output y. In general, p∗ does not
live in our model family P. We are presented with
a set of n unlabeled examples x(1) , . . . , x(n) drawn
i.i.d. from the true p∗ . In unsupervised induction,
our goal is to approximate p∗ by some model pθ ∈ P
in terms of strong generative capacity. A standard
approach is to use the EM algorithm to optimize
ˆ
the empirical likelihood E log pθ (x).1 However, EM
ˆ
only ﬁnds a local maximum, which we denote θEM ,
so there is a discrepancy between what we get (pθEM )
ˆ
and what we want (p∗ ).
We will deﬁne this discrepancy later, but for now,
it sufﬁces to remark that the discrepancy depends
on the distribution over y whereas learning depends
only on the distribution over x. This is an important
property that distinguishes unsupervised induction
from more standard supervised learning or density
estimation scenarios.
Now let us walk through the four types of erˆ
ror bottom up. First, θEM , the local maximum
ˆ
found by EM, is in general different from θ ∈
ˆ
argmaxθ E log pθ (x), any global maximum, which
we could ﬁnd given unlimited computational resources. Optimization error refers to the discrepˆ
ˆ
ancy between θ and θEM .
Second, our training data is only a noisy sample from the true p∗ . If we had inﬁnite data, we
would choose an optimal parameter setting under the
∗
model, θ2 ∈ argmaxθ E log pθ (x), where now the
expectation E is taken with respect to the true p∗ instead of the training data. The discrepancy between
∗
ˆ
θ2 and θ is the estimation error.

unlimited computation. Identiﬁability error refers to

the discrepancy between θ1 and θ2 .
Finally, the model family P has fundamental limitations. Approximation error refers to the discrep∗
∗
ancy between p∗ and pθ1 . Note that θ1 is not necessarily the best in P. If we had labeled data, we
could ﬁnd a parameter setting in P which is closer
to p∗ by optimizing joint likelihood E log pθ (x, y)
(generative training) or even conditional likelihood
E log pθ (y | x) (discriminative training).
In the remaining sections, we try to study each of
the four errors in isolation. In practice, since it is
difﬁcult to work with some of the parameter settings
that participate in the error decomposition, we use
computationally feasible surrogates so that the error
under study remains the dominant effect.

Approximation error

We start by analyzing approximation error, the dis∗
crepancy between p∗ and pθ1 (the model found by
optimizing likelihood), a point which has been dis-

cussed by many authors (Merialdo, 1994; Smith and
Eisner, 2005; Haghighi and Klein, 2006).2
To confront the question of speciﬁcally how
the likelihood diverges from prediction accuracy,
we perform the following experiment: we iniˆ
tialize EM with the supervised estimate3 θgen =
ˆ log pθ (x, y), which acts as a surrogate
argmaxθ E
for p∗ . As we run EM, the likelihood increases but
the accuracy decreases (Figure 2 shows this trend
for the PCFG; the HMM and DMV models behave
similarly). We believe that the initial iterations of
EM contain valuable information about the incorrect biases of these models. However, EM is changing hundreds of thousands of parameters at once in a
non-trivial way, so we need a way of characterizing
the important changes.
One broad observation we can make is that the
ﬁrst iteration of EM reinforces the systematic mistakes of the supervised initializer. In the ﬁrst E-step,
the posterior counts that are computed summarize
the predictions of the supervised system. If these
match the empirical counts, then the M-step does not
change the parameters. But if the supervised system
predicts too many JJs, for example, then the M-step
will update the parameters to reinforce this bias.
4.1

A meta-model for analyzing EM

We would like to go further and characterize the
speciﬁc changes EM makes. An initial approach is
to ﬁnd the parameters that changed the most during the ﬁrst iteration (weighted by the correspond2

Here, we think of discrepancy between p and p as the error
incurred when using p for prediction on examples generated
from p; in symbols, E(x,y)∼p loss(y, argmaxy p (y | x)).

For all our models, the supervised estimate is solved in
closed form by taking ratios of counts.

ing expected counts computed in the E-step). For
the HMM, the three most changed parameters are
the transitions 2:DT→8:JJ, START→0:NNP, and
8:JJ→3:NN.4 If we delve deeper, we can see that
2:DT→3:NN (the parameter with the 10th largest
change) fell and 2:DT→8:JJ rose. After checking
with a few examples, we can then deduce that some
nouns were retagged as adjectives. Unfortunately,
this type of ad-hoc reasoning requires considerable
manual effort and is rather subjective.
Instead, we propose using a general meta-model
to analyze the changes EM makes in an automatic
and objective way. Instead of treating parameters as
the primary object of study, we look at predictions
made by the model and study how they change over
time. While a model is a distribution over sentences,
a meta-model is a distribution over how the predictions of the model change.
Let R(y) denote the set of parts of a prediction y that we are interested in tracking. Each part
(c, l) ∈ R(y) consists of a conﬁguration c and a location l. For a PCFG, we deﬁne a conﬁguration to
be a rewrite rule (e.g., c = PP→IN NP), and a location l = [i, k, j] to be a span [i, j] split at k, where
the rewrite c is applied.
In this work, each conﬁguration is associated with
a parameter of the model, but in general, a conﬁguration could be a larger unit such as a subtree, allowing one to track more complex changes. The size of
a conﬁguration governs how much the meta-model
generalizes from individual examples.
Let y(i,t) denote the model prediction on the i-th
training example after t iterations of EM. To simplify notation, we write Rt = R(y(i,t) ). The metamodel explains how Rt became Rt+1 .5
In general, we expect a part in Rt+1 to be explained by a part in Rt that has a similar location
and furthermore, we expect the locations of the two
parts to be related in some consistent way. The metamodel uses two notions to formalize this idea: a distance d(l, l ) and a relation r(l, l ). For the PCFG,
d(l, l ) is the number of positions among i,j,k that
are the same as the corresponding ones in l , and
r((i, k, j), (i , k , j )) = (sign(i − i ), sign(j −

mapped to DT.

it from both sets.

j ), sign(k − k )) is one of 33 values. We deﬁne a
migration as a triple (c, c , r(l, l )); this is the unit of
change we want to extract from the meta-model.
Our meta-model provides the following generative story of how Rt becomes Rt+1 : each new part
(c , l ) ∈ Rt+1 chooses an old part (c, l) ∈ Rt with
some probability that depends on (1) the distance between the locations l and l and (2) the likelihood of
the particular migration. Formally:
pmeta (Rt+1 | Rt ) =
Zl−1 e−αd(l,l ) p(c | c, r(l, l )),
(c ,l )∈Rt+1 (c,l)∈Rt
−αd(l,l ) is a normalization
where Zl =
(c,l)∈Rt e
constant, and α is a hyperparameter controlling the
possibility of distant migrations (set to 3 in our experiments).
We learn the parameters of the meta-model with
an EM algorithm similar to the one for IBM model
1. Fortunately, the likelihood objective is convex, so
we need not worry about local optima.

4.2

Results of the meta-model

We used our meta-model to analyze the approximation errors of the HMM, DMV, and PCFG. For these
models, we initialized EM with the supervised esˆ
timate θgen and collected the model predictions as
EM ran. We then trained the meta-model on the predictions between successive iterations. The metamodel gives us an expected count for each migration. Figure 3 lists the migrations with the highest
expected counts.
From these migrations, we can see that EM tries
to explain x better by making the corresponding y
more regular. In fact, many of the HMM migrations on the ﬁrst iteration attempt to resolve inconsistencies in gold tags. For example, noun adjuncts
(e.g., stock-index), tagged as both nouns and adjectives in the Treebank, tend to become consolidated
under adjectives, as captured by migration (B). EM
also re-purposes under-utilized states to better capture distributional similarities. For example, state 24
has migrated to state 40 (N), both of which are now
dominated by proper nouns. State 40 initially contained only #, but was quickly overrun with distributionally similar proper nouns such as Oct. and Chapter, which also precede numbers, just as # does.

(c) Top PCFG migrations. Example: migration (D) means a NP→NNP NP rewrite is replaced by NP→NNP NNP,
where the new NNP right child spans less than the old NP right child.

Figure 3: We show the prominent migrations that occur during the ﬁrst 5 iterations of EM for the HMM, DMV, and
PCFG, as recovered by our meta-model. We sort the migrations across each iteration by their expected counts under
the meta-model and show the top 3. Iteration 0 corresponds to the correct outputs. Blue indicates the new iteration,
red indicates the old.

DMV migrations also try to regularize model predictions, but in a different way—in terms of the
number of arguments. Because the stop probability
is different for adjacent and non-adjacent arguments,
it is statistically much cheaper to generate one argument rather than two or more. For example, if we
train a DMV on only DT JJ NN, it can ﬁt the data
perfectly by using a chain of single arguments, but
perfect ﬁt is not possible if NN generates both DT
and JJ (which is the desired structure); this explains
migration (J). Indeed, we observed that the variance
of the number of arguments decreases with more EM
iterations (for NN, from 1.38 to 0.41).
In general, low-entropy conditional distributions
are preferred. Migration (H) explains how adverbs
now consistently attach to verbs rather than modals.
After a few iterations, the modal has committed
itself to generating exactly one verb to the right,

which is statistically advantageous because there
must be a verb after a modal, while the adverb is optional. This leaves the verb to generate the adverb.
The PCFG migrations regularize categories in a
manner similar to the HMM, but with the added
complexity of changing bracketing structures. For
example, sentential adverbs are re-analyzed as VP
adverbs (A). Sometimes, multiple migrations explain the same phenomenon.6 For example, migrations (B) and (C) indicate that PPs that previously
attached to NPs are now raised to the verbal level.
Tree rotation is another common phenomenon, leading to many left-branching structures (D,G,H). The
migrations that happen during one iteration can also
trigger additional migrations in the next. For example, the raising of the PP (B,C) inspires more of the

We could consolidate these migrations by using larger conﬁgurations, but at the risk of decreased generalization.

same raising (E). As another example, migration (I)
regularizes TO VB inﬁnitival clauses into PPs, and
this momentum carries over to the next iteration with
even greater force (J).
In summary, the meta-model facilitates our analyses by automatically identifying the broad trends.
We believe that the central idea of modeling the errors of a system is a powerful one which can be used
to analyze a wide range of models, both supervised
and unsupervised.

The above non-identiﬁabilities apply to all parameter settings, but another type of non-identiﬁability
concerns only the maximizers of E log pθ (x). Suppose the true data comes from a K-state HMM. If
we attempt to ﬁt an HMM with K + 1 states, we
can split any one of the K states and maintain the
same distribution on x. Or, if we learn a PCFG on
the same HMM data, then we can choose either the
left- or right-branching chain structures, which both
mimic the true HMM equally well.

5.1

Identiﬁability error

While approximation error is incurred when likelihood diverges from accuracy, identiﬁability error is
concerned with the case where likelihood is indifferent to accuracy.
We say a set of parameters S is identiﬁable (in
terms of x) if pθ (x) = pθ (x) for every θ, θ ∈ S
where θ = θ .7 In general, identiﬁability error is
incurred when the set of maximizers of E log pθ (x)
is non-identiﬁable.8
Label symmetry is perhaps the most familiar example of non-identiﬁability and is intrinsic to models with hidden labels (HMM and PCFG, but not
DMV). We can permute the hidden labels without
changing the objective function or even the nature
of the solution, so there is no reason to prefer one
permutation over another. While seemingly benign,
this symmetry actually presents a serious challenge
in measuring discrepancy (Section 5.1).
Grenager et al. (2005) augments an HMM to allow emission from a generic stopword distribution at
any position with probability q. Their model would
deﬁnitely not be identiﬁable if q were a free parameter, since we can set q to 0 and just mix in the stopword distribution with each of the other emission
distributions to obtain a different parameter setting
yielding the same overall distribution. This is a case
where our notion of desired structure is absent in the
likelihood, and a prior over parameters could help
break ties.

Permutation-invariant distance

KL-divergence is a natural measure of discrepancy
between two distributions, but it is somewhat nontrivial to compute—for our three recursive models, it
requires solving ﬁxed point equations, and becomes
completely intractable in face of label symmetry.
Thus we propose a more manageable alternative:
def

dµ (θ || θ ) =

j

µj |θj − θj |
j

µj

,

(1)

where we weight the difference between the j-th
component of the parameter vectors by µj , the jth expected sufﬁcient statistic with respect to pθ
(the expected counts computed in the E-step).9 Unlike KL, our distance dµ is only deﬁned on distributions in the model family and is not invariant to
reparametrization. Like KL, dµ is asymmetric, with
the ﬁrst argument holding the status of being the
“true” parameter setting. In our case, the parameters
are conditional probabilities, so 0 ≤ dµ (θ || θ ) ≤ 1,
so we can interpret dµ as an expected difference between these probabilities.
Unfortunately, label symmetry can wreak havoc
on our distance measure dµ . Suppose we want to
measure the distance between θ and θ . If θ is
simply θ with the labels permuted, then dµ (θ || θ )
would be substantial even though the distance ought
to be zero. We deﬁne a revised distance to correct
for this by taking the minimum distance over all label permutations:

7

For our three model families, θ is identiﬁable in terms of
(x, y), but not in terms of x alone.
8
We emphasize that non-identiﬁability is in terms of x, so
two parameter settings could still induce the same marginal distribution on x (weak generative capacity) while having different
joint distributions on (x, y) (strong generative capacity). Recall
that discrepancy depends on the latter.

Dµ (θ || θ ) = min dµ (θ || π(θ )),
π

9

(2)

Without this factor, rarely used components could contribute to the sum as much as frequently used ones, thus, making
the distance overly pessimistic.

where π(θ ) denotes the parameter setting resulting from permuting the labels according to π. (The
DMV has no label symmetries, so just dµ works.)
For mixture models, we can compute Dµ (θ || θ )
efﬁciently as follows. Note that each term in the
summation of (1) is associated with one of the K
labels. We can form a K × K matrix M , where each
entry Mij is the distance between the parameters involving label i of θ and label j of θ . Dµ (θ || θ ) can
then be computed by ﬁnding a maximum weighted
bipartite matching on M using the O(K 3 ) Hungarian algorithm (Kuhn, 1955).
For models such as the HMM and PCFG, computing Dµ is NP-hard, since the summation in dµ (1)
contains both ﬁrst-order terms which depend on one
label (e.g., emission parameters) and higher-order
terms which depend on more than one label (e.g.,
transitions or rewrites). We cannot capture these
problematic higher-order dependencies in M .
However, we can bound Dµ (θ || θ ) as follows.
We create M using only ﬁrst-order terms and ﬁnd
the best matching (permutation) to obtain a lower
bound Dµ and an associated permutation π0 achieving it. Since Dµ (θ || θ ) takes the minimum over all
permutations, dµ (θ || π(θ )) is an upper bound for
any π, in particular for π = π0 . We then use a local
search procedure that changes π to further tighten
the upper bound. Let Dµ denote the ﬁnal value.

Estimation error

Thus far, we have considered approximation and
identiﬁability errors, which have to do with ﬂaws of
the model. The remaining errors have to do with
how well we can ﬁt the model. To focus on these
errors, we consider the case where the true model is
in our family (p∗ ∈ P). To keep the setting as realistic as possible, we do supervised learning on real
ˆ
labeled data to obtain θ∗ = argmaxθ E log p(x, y).
We then throw away our real data and let p∗ = pθ∗ .
Now we start anew: sample new artiﬁcial data from
θ∗ , learn a model using this artiﬁcial data, and see
how close we get to recovering θ∗ .
In order to compute estimation error, we need to
ˆ
compare θ∗ with θ, the global maximizer of the likelihood on our generated data. However, we cannot
ˆ
compute θ exactly. Let us therefore ﬁrst consider the
ˆ
simpler supervised scenario. Here, θgen has a closed

form solution, so there is no optimization error. Using our distance Dµ (deﬁned in Section 5.1) to quanˆ
tify estimation error, we see that, for the HMM, θgen
quickly approaches θ∗ as we increase the amount of
data (Table 1).

Table 1: Lower and upper bounds on the distance from
the true θ∗ for the HMM as we increase the number of
examples.

In the unsupervised case, we use the following
ˆ
procedure to obtain a surrogate for θ: initialize EM
ˆ
with the supervised estimate θgen and run EM for
ˆgen-EM denote the ﬁnal param100 iterations. Let θ
ˆ
eters, which should be representative of θ. Table 1
ˆgen-EM is an order
shows that the estimation error of θ
ˆ
of magnitude higher than that of θgen , which is to exˆ
pected since θgen-EM does not have access to labeled
data. However, this error can also be driven down
given a moderate number of examples.

Optimization error

Finally, we study optimization error, which is the
ˆ
discrepancy between the global maximizer θ and
ˆ
θEM , the result of running EM starting from a uniform initialization (plus some small noise). As beˆ
ˆ
fore, we cannot compute θ, so we use θgen-EM as a
ˆgen-EM and θ
ˆ
surrogate. Also, instead of comparing θ
with each other, we compare each of their discrepancies with respect to θ∗ .
Let us ﬁrst consider optimization error in terms
of prediction error. The ﬁrst observation is that
there is a gap between the prediction accuracies
ˆ
ˆ
of θgen-EM and θEM , but this gap shrinks considerably as we increase the number of examples. Figures 4(a,b,c) support this for all three model famiˆ
ˆ
lies: for the HMM, both θgen-EM and θEM eventually
achieve around 90% accuracy; for the DMV, 85%.
ˆ
ˆ
For the PCFG, θEM still lags θgen-EM by 10%, but we
believe that more data can further reduce this gap.
Figure 4(d) shows that these trends are not particular to artiﬁcial data. On real WSJ data, the gap

ˆ
ˆ
between θgen-EM and θEM also diminishes for the
HMM. To reafﬁrm the trends, we also measure distance Dµ . Figure 4(e) shows that the distance from
ˆ
θEM to the true parameters θ∗ decreases, but the gap
ˆ
ˆ
between θgen-EM and θEM does not close as decisively as it did for prediction error.
It is quite surprising that by simply running EM
with a neutral initialization, we can accurately learn
a complex model with thousands of parameters. Figures 4(f,g) show how both likelihood and accuracy,
which both start quite low, improve substantially
over time for the HMM on artiﬁcial data.
Carroll and Charniak (1992) report that EM fared
poorly with local optima. We do not claim that there
are no local optima, but only that the likelihood surface that EM is optimizing can become smoother
with more examples. With more examples, there is
less noise in the aggregate statistics, so it might be
easier for EM to pick out the salient patterns.
Srebro et al. (2006) made a similar observation
in the context of learning Gaussian mixtures. They
characterized three regimes: one where EM was successful in recovering the true clusters (given lots of
data), another where EM failed but the global optimum was successful, and the last where both failed
(without much data).
There is also a rich body of theoretical work on

learning latent-variable models. Specialized algorithms can provably learn certain constrained discrete hidden-variable models, some in terms of weak
generative capacity (Ron et al., 1998; Clark and
Thollard, 2005; Adriaans, 1999), others in term of
strong generative capacity (Dasgupta, 1999; Feldman et al., 2005). But with the exception of Dasgupta and Schulman (2007), there is little theoretical
understanding of EM, let alone on complex model
families such as the HMM, PCFG, and DMV.

Conclusion

In recent years, many methods have improved unsupervised induction, but these methods must still deal
with the four types of errors we have identiﬁed in
this paper. One of our main contributions of this paper is the idea of using the meta-model to diagnose
the approximation error. Using this tool, we can better understand model biases and hopefully correct
for them. We also introduced a method for measuring distances in face of label symmetry and ran
experiments exploring the effectiveness of EM as a
function of the amount of data. Finally, we hope that
setting up the general framework to understand the
errors of unsupervised induction systems will aid the
development of better methods and further analyses.
